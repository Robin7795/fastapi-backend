Abstract: Data-driven technologies in smart buildings offer significant opportunities to
enhance energy efficiency, sustainability, and occupant comfort. However, the existing
literature often lacks a holistic examination of the technological advancements, adoption
barriers, and business models necessary to realize these benefits. To address this gap,
this scoping review synthesizes current research on these technologies, identifies factors
influencing their adoption, and examines supporting business models. Inspired by the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines,
a structured search of the literature across four major databases yielded 112 relevant
studies. The key technologies identified included big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence,
Machine Learning, the Internet of Things, Wireless Sensor Networks, Edge and Cloud
Computing, Blockchain, Digital Twins, and Geographic Information Systems. Energy
optimization is further achieved through integrating renewable energy resources and
advanced energy management systems, such as Home Energy Management Systems and
Building Energy Management Systems. Factors influencing adoption are categorized into
social influences, individual perceptions, cost considerations, security and privacy concerns,
and data quality issues. The analysis of business models emphasizes the need to align
technological innovations with market needs, focusing on value propositions like cost
savings and efficiency improvements. Despite the benefits, challenges such as high initial
costs, technical complexities, security risks, and user acceptance hinder their widespread
adoption. This review highlights the importance of addressing these challenges through
the development of cost-effective, interoperable, secure, and user-centric solutions, offering
a roadmap for future research and industry applications.

1. Introduction
Buildings account for approximately 40% of global energy consumption, largely due
to essential activities such as lighting, cooling, and heating [1–3]. This substantial energy
demand poses economic, resource, and environmental challenges, underscoring the need
for more efficient energy management in building environments [4]. Data-driven technolo-
gies have emerged as a critical solution for addressing these challenges, enabling smart
buildings to optimize energy use, improve occupant comfort, and support sustainable
operations [5–7]. For example, smart buildings equipped with IoT devices can collect gran-
ular energy data to inform load management and optimize energy efficiency [6]. Studies

illustrate diverse applications: multi-sensor data collection for space utilization [4], motion
sensors in libraries for lighting control [8], and Digital Twins for real-time energy efficiency
management [9]. These examples highlight the potential for data-driven technologies to
transform energy consumption dynamics within buildings through tasks like monitoring,
forecasting, and anomaly detection [10].
Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) and reinforcement learning frame-
works have enabled the development of highly adaptive Home and Building Energy
Management Systems (HEMS and BEMS) [11]. These systems optimize energy usage
through real-time data-driven decision-making approaches, leveraging techniques like fre-
quent itemset mining, deep reinforcement learning, and advanced optimization algorithms
to minimize costs and enhance efficiency [12]. By dynamically integrating real-time inputs
from IoT sensors, such as temperature, occupancy, and energy usage patterns, these systems
enable smart buildings to autonomously adjust HVAC settings, lighting, and energy loads.
Such capabilities not only enhance operational efficiency but also contribute to occupant
comfort and sustainability [13].
Although the existing literature acknowledges the benefits of data-driven technologies,
many studies lack a holistic examination of factors influencing technology adoption. For
instance, there is limited research integrating technical performance with socio-economic
factors that impact adoption, such as user behavior, regulatory frameworks, and cost
implications. Additionally, while studies explore individual technologies like IoT or AI,
they rarely provide insights into how these technologies can be integrated within a unified
framework to address energy optimization comprehensively. Furthermore, the dynamic
nature of energy markets and evolving sustainability goals highlight the need for research
that bridges technological innovation with practical implementation strategies, including
business models that can scale these solutions effectively. This gap in the literature raises
the following crucial question:
What is the current state of data-driven technologies for energy optimization in smart
buildings considering technological advancements, adoption barriers, and supporting
business models?
To address this question, this scoping review aims to perform the following:
•
Synthesize current research on data-driven technologies for energy optimization in
smart buildings.
•
Identify the factors influencing the adoption of these technologies.
•
Examine supporting business models that facilitate their implementation.
In total, 33 review articles were found in the literature (as shown in Table A1,
Appendix A), covering the following key themes:
•
Energy Management Systems: emphasize energy-saving, optimization, and con-
trol mechanisms.
•
Building Energy Efficiency: implement strategies for enhancing energy performance.
•
User Behavior and Social Factors: emphasize the influence of occupant behavior on
energy use.
•
Data-Driven Approaches: employ the use of advanced analytics and AI for predic-
tive insights.
•
Renewable Energy and Smart Grids: integrate renewables and smart grid interactions.
Compared to the existing review articles, this review advances the literature by catego-
rizing and evaluating emerging data-driven technologies, including Artificial Intelligence
(AI), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data, Blockchain, and Digital Twins. While previous
reviews discuss AI and ML generally, they rarely address the unique roles and interde-
pendencies of each technology within an integrated framework. Machine Learning (ML),

Energies 2025, 18, 290

a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), serves as a critical enabler of intelligent decision-
making within smart buildings. While AI encompasses the broader capability of machines
to simulate human intelligence, ML focuses on developing algorithms that allow systems
to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming.
For instance, ML algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Deep Learning
models can analyze complex data patterns, identify energy consumption anomalies, and
optimize predictive models for Building Energy Management. In doing so, ML supports
autonomous decision-making processes, where AI systems can dynamically adjust HVAC
settings, lighting, and energy loads in response to real-time inputs from IoT sensors, thereby
enhancing operational efficiency and occupant comfort. Additionally, this paper uniquely
examines barriers to adoption, such as security, privacy, and costs, as well as the need for
new business models to support sustainable technology implementation. These aspects
are essential for realizing the full potential of data-driven systems in energy optimization
and are underexplored in existing reviews. Overall, this scoping review aims to provide a
comprehensive view of the current state of data-driven technologies in smart buildings,
highlight critical adoption barriers, and identify gaps in business model frameworks that
could facilitate broader implementation.
The organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a background on smart
building technologies, highlighting the primary building types, unique challenges, and
opportunities influencing technology adoption. Section 3 describes the scoping review
method and process used in this paper. Section 4 discusses the foundational technologies
and system integration approaches that enable energy optimization in smart buildings.
Section 5 explores the influential factors affecting the adoption of data-driven technologies
and examines the business models that support their implementation. Section 6 presents
a discussion synthesizing key findings, implications, challenges, and limitations. Finally,
Section 7 concludes with insights and directions for future research, emphasizing the need
for enhanced security measures, user-centric designs, and innovative business models to
advance the smart building domain.
2. Background
Smart building technologies are transforming the way energy, comfort, and security
are managed in various types of buildings. The types of buildings that implement smart
technologies often determine the specific technologies and functionalities that are priori-
tized. This section provides an overview of the primary building types within the smart
building ecosystem and highlights the unique challenges and opportunities that influence
technology adoption.
The building can be a residential, commercial, or industrial building, as shown in
Table 1.
Residential buildings [14,15] comprise houses [16,17] or homes [18–22] and
flats [17]. Residential buildings are developed for various purposes, including multi-
dwelling units [23], passive house design [24], and home-based small businesses [25].
In residential settings, smart technologies primarily focus on occupant comfort, energy
efficiency, and security. Their key functionalities often include automated lighting, climate
control, and security systems, alongside renewable energy integration and energy manage-
ment systems that allow homeowners to monitor and optimize consumption. Technologies
such as IoT-enabled sensors and smart thermostats are popular in this sector, balancing
convenience with energy savings to meet consumer preferences.
Commercial buildings are structures utilized for business activities, including of-
fices [17,26–30], school buildings [3,7,17,30,31], public buildings [32,33], libraries [8], retail
shops [15], and research and development buildings [34]. Other types of commercial
buildings are airports [28], hotels [17,28], banks [17], restaurants [17], and hospitals [17].

Energies 2025, 18, 290

Commercial buildings, including office complexes, retail spaces, and hotels, prioritize
occupant comfort, efficient space utilization, and optimized energy consumption. Given
the high energy demands in these environments, smart building solutions often involve
advanced HVAC control systems, occupancy-based lighting, and Building Management
Systems (BMS) that integrate multiple functions for centralized management. Data analytics
and AI-driven predictive maintenance are also commonly used to reduce operational costs
and improve building performance.
Government buildings, hospitals, and schools, which fall under institutional categories,
often prioritize sustainability, occupant well-being, and public safety. Smart building
technologies in these spaces frequently include energy-efficient HVAC systems, emergency
response automation, and environmental monitoring to ensure healthy indoor air quality.
Digital twin technologies are increasingly being explored in these settings for scenario
planning and efficient resource management.
Additionally, industrial buildings [15] are structures used for production or manu-
facturing, such as data centers [35] and warehouses [14]. In industrial facilities such as
factories and warehouses, the focus shifts to operational efficiency, safety, and resource
management. Smart technologies for these buildings may include IoT-enabled machinery
monitoring, energy-intensive process optimization, and robust security and safety sys-
tems. Technologies in industrial buildings are often integrated with energy management
and automation systems to optimize production processes while reducing downtime and
energy use.
Cognitive buildings incorporate the Internet of Things (IoT) and other related tech-
nologies to develop an information-driven environment [36]. Similarly, smart buildings
are equipped with intelligent systems to automatically control building technologies (e.g.,
heating, lighting, ventilation), aiming to minimize energy usage while ensuring occupant
comfort and operational efficiency [37]. For example, smart homes [1,38–54], considered
smart buildings, are equipped with a unified and centrally integrated system that manages
electrical devices and appliances [40].

3. Materials and Methods
This scoping review was conducted to systematically explore the role of data-driven
technologies in optimizing energy consumption in smart buildings. The methodology
was inspired by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines [56], adapted to the broader objectives of a scoping review. The
review aimed to map existing research, identify key themes and gaps, and provide an
overview of advancements in data-driven technologies, adoption barriers, and business
models relevant to smart buildings.
To ensure a structured and transparent approach, the review incorporated elements
of the PRISMA framework, including clearly defined eligibility criteria, comprehensive
database searches, and a systematic study selection process illustrated by a PRISMA
flow diagram. The selection process involved several stages: (1) identification through
automated database searches, (2) screening based on titles and abstracts, and (3) full-text
assessments against predefined criteria (Table A2). Studies were included if they specifically
addressed data-driven technologies in smart buildings with a focus on energy optimization,
adoption barriers, or business models. Exclusion criteria included studies lacking primary
data or robust methodologies, publications not in English, or those with a focus outside
smart building contexts.
During the screening stage, duplicates were first removed, and titles and abstracts
were reviewed independently by two authors. Conflicts were resolved through discussion
or consultation with a third author. Examples of excluded studies included those focusing
on generic smart technologies without reference to energy systems (e.g., IoT for healthcare)
or articles presenting conceptual frameworks without empirical support. The eligibility
phase involved a detailed examination of full texts for relevance and methodological
soundness. Reasons for exclusion at this stage included an insufficient focus on data-driven
energy optimization (e.g., discussions limited to structural engineering) and the lack of a
peer-reviewed status. The final synthesis included 112 studies.
While formal quality appraisal and meta-analysis were not performed—consistent
with the aims of scoping reviews—a narrative synthesis and thematic categorization were
used to analyze the findings. This approach allowed for the inclusion of diverse evidence
types and a broad exploration of the research landscape.
3.1. Protocol and Registration
A review protocol was developed prior to the commencement of this scoping review
to ensure methodological rigor, transparency, and consistency. The protocol outlined
the review’s objectives, eligibility criteria, data sources, search strategies, study selection

Energies 2025, 18, 290

process, and data extraction methods. This scoping review was not formally registered in
any public database, such as PROSPERO, as scoping reviews are currently not eligible for
registration there. However, to maintain transparency, the protocol was internally reviewed
and approved by the research team before implementation. Any deviations from the
initial protocol during the review process were documented and justified within the review.
The protocol is not publicly available; however, detailed descriptions of the methodology,
including the eligibility criteria, information sources, search strategy, and data extraction
process, are provided in the section below to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
3.2. Eligibility Criteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were carefully defined to align with the research
question, which aims to explore the role of data-driven technologies in optimizing energy
consumption within smart buildings, as shown in Figure 1. The criteria prioritized research
that provided empirical evidence, insights into user experiences, and practical applications
of these technologies. The focus on peer-reviewed publications ensured the inclusion of
high-quality research, acknowledging that it might introduce potential bias by excluding
valuable information from gray literature. The language restriction was due to resource
constraints, and the publication year timeframe captured the period of significant advance-
ments in the field. By clearly defining these criteria, this review provides a comprehensive
and rigorous analysis of the selected literature.
 
Figure 1. Eligibility criteria.
3.3. Information Sources
To comprehensively capture relevant studies on data-driven technologies for energy
optimization in smart buildings, a systematic search was conducted across multiple in-
formation sources, ensuring a broad and representative coverage of the field. To ensure
comprehensive coverage, multiple electronic databases were searched, including Scopus,
Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. The search included articles pub-
lished up to February 2024, ensuring that the most recent developments were considered.
Meanwhile, domain experts were consulted to validate the comprehensiveness of the search
strategy and identify any potentially overlooked key studies.

3.4. Search Strategy
A systematic and transparent search strategy was employed to identify the relevant
literature. The primary objective of the search strategy was to identify a comprehensive
dataset of peer-reviewed studies that address the intersection of smart building technolo-
gies, data-driven approaches, and adoption barriers or facilitators. The search also sought
to include diverse research contexts across building types (residential, commercial, and
industrial buildings). The search strings were tailored for each database, applying filters
for language and document type. Domain experts were consulted to confirm the strategy’s
coverage and relevance. The full search strings and details on how the strategy was refined
are provided in Appendix B.1. Search strategy.
3.5. Study Selection
The selection of studies followed a structured, multi-stage approach designed to
ensure rigor and transparency. After removing duplicates, two independent reviewers ini-
tially screened all titles and abstracts against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria
(Table A2). Studies meeting these criteria or considered potentially relevant were then as-
sessed through a full-text examination. Throughout both the screening and full-text review
stages, any disagreements were resolved through discussion, and when necessary, a third
reviewer served as an adjudicator to maintain impartial decision-making. The PRISMA
flow diagram (Figure 2) below summarizes the selection process, and Appendix B.2, Study
Selection, provides a comprehensive record of the inclusion decisions and justifications.
 
Figure 2. The PRISMA flow diagram.
3.6. Data Charting, Management, and Items
Data extraction and management were conducted systematically to ensure compre-
hensive and accurate synthesis. All 112 articles, including their abstracts and full texts,

Energies 2025, 18, 290
8 of 52
were imported into EndNote 21 for efficient organization, annotation, and retrieval. A
standardized data extraction form (Table A3, Appendix B.3. Data Charting, Management,
and Items) was developed to record the study focus, methodologies, key findings, and
contextual details. The process involved independent charting by two reviewers, iterative
refinement, and final quality assurance.
Key data items were systematically charted (Table A4, Appendix B.3. Data Charting,
Management, and Items), including publication details, study classifications, geographic
context, targeted building types, technologies, adoption factors, and key findings. These
elements provided the foundation for categorizing and analyzing the studies to address
the research objectives and highlight gaps and opportunities for further investigation.
3.7. Data Synthesis
The synthesis of the included studies followed a structured process involving cate-
gorization, thematic analysis, contextual examination, and alignment with the research
questions to systematically present findings. A total of 112 studies were analyzed and cate-
gorized into 33 review articles (Table A1, Appendix A) and 79 research articles (Table A5,
Appendix C). These studies explored diverse aspects of data-driven technologies in build-
ing and energy systems, providing insights into energy optimization, smart building
management, and data-driven decision-making processes.
To further refine the analysis, Table 2 categorizes the studies into three primary
aspects—energy, building, and data/AI—along with their subcategories. Among the
included studies, 11 specifically addressed adoption barriers such as high costs, security
concerns, and technical complexities. Additionally, three studies focused on business mod-
els, exploring innovative practices for commercialization and the sustainable integration of
data-driven technologies.

and system integration approaches adopted in smart buildings. It covers data-driven
technologies, energy resources, energy management systems, and the integration of these
components to enhance building performance and sustainability.
4.1. Data-Driven Technologies in Smart Buildings
Data-driven technologies drive innovation and efficiency across buildings and energy
systems. These technologies include big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine
Learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks, Edge and Cloud
Computing, Blockchain, Digital Twins, Information Systems, and Geographic Information
Systems (GIS), as shown in Table 3.

4.1.1. Big Data Analytics
Big data analytics involves the collection, processing, and analysis of large and com-
plex datasets to extract meaningful insights and identify patterns that inform decision-
making [57,58]. Characterized by the three Vs—volume, velocity, and variety—big data
technologies enable the handling of datasets that are too large or complex for traditional
data-processing applications.
In the context of smart buildings, methodologies such as data mining, clustering, and
regression analysis are frequently employed to uncover patterns and relationships within
energy consumption data. For example, data mining techniques, including association rules
and decision trees, help identify anomalies and predict future energy demands [28]. These
tools allow facility managers to gain insights into usage patterns, predict maintenance

Energies 2025, 18, 290

needs, and improve operational efficiency. These tools support applications, including
energy forecasting, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance.
In the context of smart buildings, big data analytics play a pivotal role in optimizing
building operations and enhancing energy efficiency. For instance, Koseleva and Ropaite
(2017) proposed a big data-based architecture for building management systems (BMS) to
effectively manage daily operations [57]. By analyzing the vast amounts of data generated
from sensors and systems within a building, facility managers could gain insights into
usage patterns, predict maintenance needs, and improve overall operational efficiency.
The methodologies applied include supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning al-
gorithms. Supervised learning techniques such as Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted
Trees are used to forecast energy consumption and identify anomalies in usage patterns.
Unsupervised learning methods, like k-means clustering, help segment energy usage be-
haviors across different building zones. Additionally, predictive maintenance models often
integrate time-series analysis using algorithms like ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated
Moving Average) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for enhanced fault de-
tection and maintenance scheduling. These methods ensure proactive energy management
and system reliability.
Big data are classified based on their size into small (kilobytes to gigabytes), medium
(gigabytes to terabytes), and large (terabytes and beyond) datasets (as shown in Table 4).
This classification guides the choice of tools and frameworks used for data processing. For
small-to-medium datasets, Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn)
and R are widely employed due to their robust capabilities for data manipulation and
statistical analysis [58,68]. For large-scale datasets, distributed frameworks like Apache
Spark and Hadoop are essential, providing the scalability needed to handle high-volume
data processing in real time [58,67]. These tools support advanced analytics applications
such as energy consumption forecasting, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance
in smart building systems.

Limitations
Hardware constraints, integration with legacy BMS, and high computational
requirements for real-time tasks.
However, integrating data-driven technologies requires significant technical expertise
and careful planning. A key limitation in this area is the difficulty of ensuring interop-
erability between new systems and legacy building technologies. Incompatibility often
arises, requiring substantial customization efforts that increase both costs and complexity.
Many smart building systems rely on seamless integration, and overcoming these techni-
cal barriers is essential to achieving widespread adoption. Furthermore, many existing
BMS lack the hardware capabilities needed to process large-scale datasets in real time,
necessitating the use of external data infrastructures. This adds complexity in terms of
data integration, standardization, and compatibility with distributed frameworks [57,67].

Energies 2025, 18, 290

Hardware constraints, coupled with high computational requirements, further limit the
real-time analytics potential of embedded systems.
In the energy sector, big data analytics is utilized to understand individual and collec-
tive energy consumption behaviors, leading to strategies that enhance energy efficiency [57].
For instance, [69] highlights the use of automated data mining methods on whole-building
electricity data to uncover insights related to energy efficiency opportunities. By identify-
ing consumption trends and anomalies, stakeholders can implement targeted measures to
reduce energy waste and promote sustainability.
Beyond smart buildings and energy, big data analytics has broad applications across
various industries, including automotive, telecommunications, healthcare, media, travel,
social media, and more [57]. In the domain of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE), the
application of big data and advanced analytics has resulted in cost reductions, process
improvements, faster decision-making, and enhanced customer offerings [58].
By leveraging big data tools and frameworks tailored to specific use cases, smart
buildings can achieve real-time monitoring, proactive anomaly detection, and predictive
maintenance. This integration enhances energy optimization, operational cost reduction,
and occupant comfort while overcoming traditional limitations.
4.1.2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that are
capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning,
learning, and decision-making [42]. Within the broader domain of AI, Machine Learning
(ML) is a specialized subset that focuses on algorithms allowing systems to learn and
improve from data without explicit programming [3,14,25,41,51,60,61]. This distinction is
critical, as AI encompasses a wide array of techniques, while ML focuses on data-driven
algorithmic learning.
In smart buildings, AI automates tasks and adapts to user preferences, enhancing
functionality and convenience. For example, AI algorithms can optimize energy consump-
tion by adjusting lighting, HVAC systems, and renewable energy integration [2,33,49]. AI
also supports anomaly detection in energy usage, enabling proactive maintenance and
energy-saving strategies [38].
ML techniques further advance these capabilities by predicting future energy con-
sumption patterns, forecasting costs, and improving the efficiency of energy systems [38].
Specific ML methods employed in smart buildings include the following:
•
Ensemble Learning Methods: techniques like Boosted Trees and Random Forests
are used to predict and analyze energy performance in individual buildings and
clusters [2,3].
•
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVM methods, including Linear, Quadratic, and Cubic
SVMs, are utilized for energy consumption prediction and anomaly detection [3,29].
•
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Deep Learning: ANNs and Deep Learn-
ing models, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Deep Reinforcement
Learning, are applied for complex pattern recognition and predictive analytics in
energy management.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): DNNs build on ANNs by incorporating multiple
hidden layers and enabling the modeling of complex patterns and relationships in
high-dimensional datasets. They are especially effective for advanced applications
like image recognition, non-linear energy demand forecasting, and natural language
processing [2,41,52,67].

For example, DNNs have been applied in smart building systems to forecast peak
demand, optimize HVAC operations, and manage energy storage systems, utilizing features
like temperature, occupancy rates, and historical consumption patterns.
Detailed methodologies include feature engineering (e.g., selecting relevant data
inputs like temperature and occupancy), model training on historical data using cross-
validation techniques, and performance evaluation with metrics such as Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²). These practices ensure that models are robust and
generalizable to unseen scenarios.
4.1.3. Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected devices and objects that
communicate and exchange data over the Internet or other communication networks [37,39].
In smart buildings, IoT technologies play a pivotal role in collecting real-time data on energy
usage, environmental conditions, and occupant behaviors, enabling more efficient and
responsive building management systems [1,7,8,14,16,20,21,27,36,37,39,41,45,47–49,51,62,70].
IoT systems in smart buildings typically consist of various components:
•
Sensors and Actuators: These devices detect and measure environmental parameters such
as temperature, humidity, light levels, and occupancy. Actuators execute physical actions
based on control signals, such as adjusting thermostats or lighting [18,34,36,39,47,70].
•

tioning (HVAC) systems based on occupancy and environmental conditions [47,70].
•
Smart Lighting Systems: the dynamic control of lighting based on occupancy and
natural light availability to reduce energy consumption [8,70].
•
By integrating IoT and WSN technologies, smart buildings can achieve enhanced
operational efficiency, improved occupant comfort, and reduced energy consumption
through data-driven decision-making and automation.
4.1.4. Edge and Cloud Computing

enables real-time data analysis and decision-making, which is critical for applications like
security systems, energy management, and occupant comfort adjustments.
For example, ref. [61] utilized edge computing with a Raspberry Pi as an edge IoT
device to perform facial recognition locally, enhancing security while minimizing data trans-
mission to external servers. Edge computing also contributes to energy savings by reducing
the energy consumption associated with data transmission and remote processing [2].
Cloud Computing provides scalable, cost-effective off-site data storage and process-
ing services over the internet [2,16,52]. In smart buildings, Cloud Computing facilitates
centralized data management, analytics, and access to advanced computational resources.
An example is the integration of cloud services in Home Energy Management Systems
(HEMS). Reference [16] demonstrated the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS IoT Core)
to manage incoming data messages and deliver data-driven services and applications,
enhancing the capabilities of HEMS without the need for extensive on-site infrastructure.
Methodologies for integration often include secure APIs to transfer data from Edge nodes to
the cloud and the leveraging of cloud-native tools for predictive analytics and visualization.
By leveraging both Edge and Cloud Computing, smart buildings can optimize perfor-
mance by processing critical data locally while utilizing cloud resources for more extensive
data analytics, storage, and services.
4.1.5. Blockchain Technologies
Blockchain technology provides a decentralized, secure, and transparent method for
recording transactions and data sharing across distributed networks. Applications include
peer-to-peer energy trading and the secure storage of IoT sensor data [23,62,65]. In smart
buildings, Blockchain can enhance security, trust, and efficiency in energy transactions and
data management.
Applications of Blockchain in smart buildings include the following:

IoT devices and sensors are ensured, enhancing trust among stakeholders [23,62].
For instance, ref. [62] proposed a Trusted Digital Building Logbook architecture us-
ing Blockchain and Digital Twin technologies to safeguard privacy and ensure secure
data transactions. By minimizing information disparities and fostering trustworthy re-
lationships, Blockchain technology can contribute to more efficient and secure building
management systems.
The methodology involves creating smart contracts to automate transactions and
validate data authenticity. For example, Ethereum-based frameworks are commonly used
in Blockchain implementations for energy systems, ensuring the tamper-proof recording of
energy usage or trading activity. Challenges such as computational overhead and scalability
are addressed using lightweight consensus algorithms like Proof of Authority (PoA) or
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).
4.1.6. Digital Twin Technologies
Digital Twin (DT) technologies involve creating virtual replicas of physical systems
that integrate real-time sensor data, simulations, and historical information [62,66]. In
smart buildings, Digital Twins enable the real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance,
and optimization of building performance.
Applications of Digital Twins in smart buildings include the following:

•
Real-Time Monitoring: this provides a comprehensive view of building systems’ status,
allowing the immediate detection of issues and informed decision-making [62,66].
Methodologies for real-time monitoring often leverage IoT sensors and data acquisition
tools to feed accurate and continuous updates into Digital Twin platforms, ensuring
up-to-date system representations.
•
Predictive Maintenance: data analytics are utilized to predict equipment failures
or maintenance needs, reducing downtime and maintenance costs [66]. Machine
Learning algorithms such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or ARIMA
models are commonly used for forecasting failures, enabling proactive interventions.
•
Optimization of Building Performance: Different scenarios are simulated to improve
energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and operational strategies [62]. Simulation tools,
such as MATLAB Simulink or EnergyPlus, are often integrated with Digital Twins to
test and refine system responses under varying conditions.
For example, ref. [66] developed a Digital Twin prototype for HVAC systems, inte-
grating sensor data and simulations to predict system behavior and optimize performance.
Similarly, ref. [62] presented an architecture combining Blockchain and Digital Twin tech-
nologies to enhance data security and building management. This integration ensures that
the data that are driving decisions are both accurate and tamper-proof, addressing key
concerns around trust and reliability in data-driven systems.
4.1.7. Information Systems and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
Information Systems (IS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are critical tools
for storing, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting data related to smart buildings and
energy management.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide spatial analysis capabilities that are
essential for the following:
•
Energy Distribution Management: energy distribution networks are managed by
performing real-time monitoring, maintenance, and outage response [19]. Advanced
GIS platforms integrate real-time sensor data with spatial models to enhance the
accuracy of monitoring and facilitate automated responses during outages.
•
Energy Consumption Mapping: visual representations are created of energy consump-
tion across buildings or regions, facilitating the identification of high-consumption
areas and opportunities for efficiency improvements [32,67]. These visualizations often
rely on heatmaps or choropleth maps generated through tools like ArcGIS, which
allow for the easy identification of energy usage patterns.
•
Solar Energy Potential Analysis: the solar energy that rooftops can capture is estimated
while considering shading effects from nearby structures [67]. Methodologies for this
analysis frequently include 3D-GIS modeling and LiDAR-based data integration to
enhance accuracy.
For instance, ref. [32] used GIS to create maps representing buildings with color-
coded blocks corresponding to their energy performance grades. Additionally, ref. [67]
proposed a 3D-GIS approach to predict solar energy potential in urban areas. Such tools
provide actionable insights for energy planners and policymakers, enabling the optimized
deployment of solar infrastructure.
Information Systems such as EnerGis, a GIS designed for modeling energy service
requirements, provide platforms for integrating various data sources and supporting
decision-making processes in energy management [29]. These systems often integrate IoT-
generated data with historical and forecasted datasets, allowing for dynamic simulations
of energy management scenarios. By incorporating multi-criteria decision-making tools, IS
and GIS platforms can optimize resource allocation and project planning.

By leveraging IS and GIS technologies, smart buildings and urban planners can
utilize data-driven decisions to enhance energy efficiency, plan infrastructure, and promote
sustainable development. These technologies support long-term urban planning efforts
by aligning sustainability goals with operational strategies, ensuring that energy systems
meet future demands effectively.

sustainable smart buildings. By integrating these resources, smart buildings can generate,
store, and utilize energy more efficiently, reducing reliance on non-renewable energy
sources and minimizing environmental impact.
•
Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems: Solar PV panels convert sunlight directly into
electricity, providing a clean and renewable energy source for buildings. They are
widely adopted in smart buildings to reduce grid dependency and lower energy
costs [21,24,38,43,55,67].
•

applications, such as water heating and space heating. Incorporating thermal storage
allows excess heat to be stored for use during periods without sunlight, enhancing
energy availability and efficiency [24].
•
Ground-Source Heat Pump (GSHP) Systems: GSHPs utilize the stable temperatures
beneath the Earth’s surface to provide heating and cooling for buildings. By exchang-
ing heat with the ground, these systems offer higher efficiency compared to traditional
HVAC systems [24].
•
Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and Batteries: ESS, including batteries, store excess
energy generated from renewable sources like solar PV. Stored energy can be used
during peak demand times or when renewable generation is low, improving energy
reliability and reducing costs [21,38].
•

into smart buildings supports the adoption of electric mobility. EVs can also act as
mobile energy storage units, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies enable energy
exchange between EVs and buildings [38,43].
•
Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR): MVHR systems improve energy
efficiency by recovering heat from outgoing stale air and transferring it to incoming
fresh air. This process reduces the energy required for heating or cooling incoming air,
enhancing indoor air quality and comfort [24].
4.2.2. Energy Management and Automation Systems

smart buildings, enabling the efficient monitoring, control, and optimization of energy con-
sumption. These systems leverage advanced technologies to enhance operational efficiency,
reduce energy costs, and improve occupant comfort. Table 5 provides an overview of the

Home Energy Management and Monitoring Systems
Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) are designed to empower homeowners
with real-time insights into their energy consumption patterns. By providing detailed infor-
mation on energy usage, HEMS can enable users to make informed decisions to reduce costs
and improve efficiency. For example, standard HEMS platforms [16,18,19,34,41,51,52] al-
low users to monitor energy consumption through mobile apps or web interfaces, schedule
appliance operations during off-peak hours, and receive alerts about unusual energy usage.
Building on this foundation, Intelligent Home Energy Management Systems (AiHEMS)
incorporate artificial intelligence to learn from user behaviors and environmental data such
as temperature, humidity, and occupancy [72]. By dynamically adjusting settings based on
this information, AiHEMS can optimize energy consumption without compromising com-
fort. For instance, they might lower the amount of energy spent on heating or cooling when
the occupants are away from home or adjust lighting based on natural light availability.
Other specialized systems include Smart Home Power Management solutions [47],
which automate the control of appliances and electrical systems, often integrating with
smart grids to manage power consumption more efficiently. Home Energy Monitor-
ing Systems [20] focus on providing detailed real-time data to help users identify high-
consumption devices and implement energy-saving measures. IoT-based Energy Mon-
itoring Systems [50] utilize connected sensors to collect granular data, enabling remote

monitoring and control via smartphones or other devices. Additionally, Standby-Power
Management Systems [30] aim to reduce energy waste by automatically cutting power to
devices in standby mode.
Building Energy Management and Monitoring Systems
In commercial and large-scale buildings, Building Energy Management Systems
(BEMS) are crucial for overseeing energy consumption across various systems such as
heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and security. Energy Management
Systems (EMS [43,49]) provide centralized control, employing strategies for energy con-
servation and cost reduction. By integrating data from multiple sources, these systems
allow facility managers to monitor performance, identify inefficiencies, and implement
corrective actions.
Building Energy Management Systems [28,68] take a holistic approach by integrating
multiple building systems, enabling optimization across different energy domains. These
systems can adjust HVAC operations based on occupancy patterns or optimize lighting
levels according to daylight availability, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Building
Energy Monitoring and Management Systems [71] focus on detailed monitoring, providing
tools to manage and optimize consumption effectively.
Building Management Systems (BMS) [7] facilitate the management of building opera-
tions, including energy usage, environmental conditions, and safety systems, enhancing
both efficiency and occupant comfort. These systems often include features like real-time
monitoring, automated control, and data analytics to support decision-making processes.
Building Automation Systems (BAS) [26] automate the control of services like HVAC and
lighting, adjusting settings based on real-time data from sensors and occupancy patterns,
which can lead to significant energy savings and improved environmental conditions
within the building.
Energy management systems (EMS) play a critical role in optimizing energy use
in smart buildings. These systems leverage advanced technologies like IoT, Machine
Learning, and Cloud Computing to monitor and control energy consumption. However,
the scalability of these systems remains a challenge, particularly in larger buildings or
multi-site deployments. Current EMS solutions often struggle to accommodate the growing
volume of data generated by expanding sensor networks, highlighting the need for scalable
architectures and robust processing capabilities.
Smart and Automated Systems for Homes and Offices
Automation systems enhance intelligence and convenience in residential and office
environments, contributing to energy efficiency and user comfort. Home Automation
Systems [21,39] automate functions such as lighting, climate control, security, and appliance
management, often allowing control via mobile devices or voice commands. For example,
a homeowner can remotely adjust the thermostat or turn off the lights using a smartphone
app, reducing unnecessary energy consumption.
Smart Home and Building Automation Applications [46] integrate multiple devices
and systems, providing seamless automation and enhanced user experience. These ap-
plications can coordinate the operation of various smart devices, enabling scenarios like
automatically adjusting blinds and lighting depending on when the sun sets. Wireless
Home Automation Systems [54] utilize wireless communication protocols to connect de-
vices, simplifying installation and expanding flexibility, which is particularly beneficial in
retrofit situations where running new wiring is impractical.
In office settings, smart office systems [61] automate operations, including environ-
mental controls, lighting, and access systems, improving energy efficiency and employee

productivity. For instance, smart systems can adjust ventilation and temperature based
on occupancy levels, enhancing comfort while conserving energy. Smart Office Lighting
Control Systems [70] adjust lighting based on occupancy and daylight availability, reducing
energy consumption while maintaining a comfortable work environment.
Specialized Control and Data Management Systems
Specialized systems offer advanced functionalities for data acquisition and control
in smart buildings. The Versatile Sensor Data Acquisition and Control System (VSDACS)
ref. [15] manages data from various utility sensors, such as electricity, water, gas, air flow,
and solar energy. By providing real-time data processing, storage, and alert generation,
VSDACS supports decision-making processes and enhances operational efficiency. Facility
managers can, for example, receive immediate notifications of anomalies like water leaks
or unusual energy spikes.
Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based Intelligent Illumination Systems [8] uti-
lize BIM to optimize lighting controls based on building design and occupancy patterns.
By integrating design data with real-time occupancy information, these systems can ad-
just the lighting in different zones of a building, ensuring adequate illumination where
needed while saving energy in unoccupied areas. Energy-aware data gathering techniques
(EDGE) [64] focus on optimizing data collection in Wireless Sensor Networks, conserving
energy in sensor nodes while ensuring accurate and reliable data transmission. This is
particularly important for battery-powered sensors where energy efficiency extends the
operational life of devices.
The integration of these energy management and automation systems in data-driven
smart buildings significantly enhances energy efficiency, reduces operational costs, and
promotes sustainability. These systems enable the proactive management of energy con-
sumption and contribute to the overall performance and environmental impact of smart
buildings by leveraging advanced technologies and data analytics. The synergy between
energy management systems and data-driven technologies forms the backbone of modern
smart buildings, paving the way for more sustainable and intelligent built environments.
4.2.3. Energy Modeling and Fault Detection
Accurate energy modeling and effective fault detection are essential for optimizing
energy usage and maintaining the reliable operation of building systems.
Building Energy Modeling and Simulation
Building energy modeling involves creating digital representations of buildings to
simulate and analyze energy consumption. This process helps in designing energy-efficient
buildings and retrofitting existing structures. A comprehensive building energy simulation
program is used to model heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and other energy flows
within a building [14].
In our discussion, we focus on simulation methods relevant to walls, roofs, and
indoor air (room temperature). Tools such as EnergyPlus (U.S. Department of Energy.
https://energyplus.net, accessed 8 December 2024) and TRNSYS (Solar Energy Laboratory,
University of Wisconsin-Madison. https://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys, accessed 8 Decem-
ber 2024) are widely employed, but each handles these components with the following
distinct solvers:
•
EnergyPlus
#
Conduction Transfer Function (CTF) Method for Opaque Walls and Roofs: by
default, EnergyPlus uses a CTF-based approach for most conventional building

Energies 2025, 18, 290

envelopes (walls and roofs). This method balances computational speed with
acceptable accuracy for standard construction materials.
#
Finite Difference Method (FDM) for Advanced Materials: for walls or roofs incor-
porating complex materials (e.g., Phase Change Materials), EnergyPlus employs
an FDM approach, allowing a more detailed layer-by-layer temperature profile.
#
Moisture Transfer and Room Air: some EnergyPlus modules incorporate addi-
tional solvers for moisture transfer within walls. Meanwhile, room air (zone)
temperature is solved with iterative heat balance methods that couple radiative
and convective processes in the zone air.
•
TRNSYS
#
Differential-Algebraic Equation (DAE)-Based Approach with Modular Com-
ponents: TRNSYS is known for its DAE-solving capabilities and its flexible,
modular setup. However, for building simulations, TRNSYS employs specific
approaches for each component, including the walls and zone air.
#
Component-Level Solvers for Walls: each wall, roof, or other envelope compo-
nent (often referred to as a “Type” in TRNSYS) has its own solver strategy to
handle heat conduction and sometimes mass transfer.
#
Room/Zone Air: the zone temperature is updated using a separate solver that
couples convective, radiative, and (if necessary) latent (moisture) heat flows at
the zone boundary.
#
Renewable or Specialized Systems: while TRNSYS can simultaneously solve
renewable energy systems (e.g., solar thermal) in the same simulation environ-
ment, this flexibility lies outside the scope of the wall, roof, and room-air solvers
discussed here.

Challenges in building energy modeling include accounting for diverse building
types, climates, and occupancy behaviors and accurately predicting system interactions.
For example, variations in weather patterns or unexpected changes in occupant behavior
can introduce uncertainties into model outputs. To address these challenges, advanced
tools like DesignBuilder (based on EnergyPlus) and IDA ICE incorporate Monte Carlo
simulations to quantify uncertainties and provide probabilistic forecasts [73]. It is essential
to understand how each solver handles heat transfer through walls, roofs, and indoor
air to ensure modeling accuracy, as different solvers may be more suitable for specific
configurations or material types. Continuous validation and calibration with real-world
data enhance the reliability of simulation results, ensuring that models remain applicable
to practical scenarios [74,75].

Energies 2025, 18, 290

In addition to EnergyPlus and TRNSYS, other tools provide specialized functional-
ities but generally follow a similar philosophy: focusing on envelope heat conduction
(walls, roofs, windows) and zone-level temperature simulation. This ensures that the
core building envelope and indoor thermal environment are accurately represented before
extending to additional features (e.g., advanced HVAC, humidity transfer, and specialized
renewable systems):
•
DesignBuilder: this provides a user-friendly interface for EnergyPlus, supporting
parametric analyses to optimize energy performance.
•
OpenStudio: this integrates with EnergyPlus and enables advanced customizations of
simulation parameters for specialized projects.
•
IDA ICE: this focuses on indoor climate and energy analysis, using modular simula-
tions and advanced equation solvers for precise calculations.
•
IES VE: this combines 3D modeling with dynamic simulations, supporting detailed
environmental and energy assessments.
These tools employ various algorithms, including finite element analysis (FEA) for
thermal modeling, ODE solvers for transient processes, and Monte Carlo simulations
for uncertainty analysis [73,74]. By leveraging these diverse approaches, engineers and
architects can select tools that best align with their project requirements, from simple energy
efficiency assessments to complex renewable energy integrations.
Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD)
Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems are essential components in smart build-
ings, serving to promptly identify anomalies or faults within building systems. By enabling
timely interventions, FDD systems help prevent energy waste, avoid equipment failure, and
ensure the optimal performance of building operations. These systems continuously moni-
tor various building services, such as HVAC, lighting, and electrical systems, facilitating
proactive maintenance and reducing downtime [2,68].
A critical aspect of modern FDD systems is the incorporation of Artificial Intelli-
gence (AI)-based anomaly detection techniques. Machine Learning algorithms analyze
energy consumption patterns and operational data to detect deviations that may indicate
faults or inefficiencies [2]. These algorithms can operate under the following different
learning paradigms:
•
Supervised Learning involves training models on labeled datasets where known fault
patterns are identified. The model learns to recognize these patterns and can detect
similar faults in new, unlabeled data.
•
Unsupervised Learning does not require labeled data. Instead, the algorithm identifies
normal operational patterns and flags any deviations from these patterns as potential
anomalies, making it effective for detecting new or unexpected faults.
•
Semi-Supervised Learning combines elements of both supervised and Unsupervised
Learning. It utilizes a small amount of labeled data along with a larger set of unlabeled
data to improve detection accuracy, especially when labeled data are scarce.
Fault detection approaches are broadly classified into two categories: data-driven
methods and knowledge-driven methods. Data-driven methods rely on statistical anal-
ysis and Machine Learning to identify patterns and anomalies directly from operational
data without the need for explicit models of system behavior [26]. These methods are
particularly useful when dealing with complex systems where modeling every component
is impractical.
On the other hand, knowledge-driven methods utilize expert knowledge, predefined
rules, and models of expected system behavior to detect deviations indicative of faults [76].
These methods are effective when the comprehensive understanding and modeling of

Energies 2025, 18, 290

the system are feasible, allowing for the precise identification of anomalies based on
established criteria.
Implementing robust energy modeling and FDD systems brings several benefits to
smart buildings:
•
Energy Efficiency: By identifying and correcting inefficiencies, FDD systems reduce
unnecessary energy consumption and lower operational costs. Detecting faults early
prevents the wastage of energy that occurs when systems operate sub-optimally.
•
System Reliability: The early detection of faults prevents minor issues from escalating
into major equipment failures. This proactive approach extends the lifespan of building
systems and minimizes disruptions to building operations.
•
Occupant Comfort: Maintaining optimal system performance ensures that indoor
environmental conditions remain within the desired comfort levels. Effective FDD
contributes to consistent temperature control, air quality, and lighting, enhancing
occupant satisfaction.
5. Influential Factors for the Adoption and Business Models of
Data-Driven Technologies
5.1. Factors Influencing the Adoption of Data-Driven Technologies
The successful deployment of data-driven technologies in smart buildings largely
depends on user acceptance and willingness to adopt these innovations. Failure to un-
derstand users’ needs, preferences, and expectations is a significant reason why many
projects do not succeed [77]. Among the most critical barriers is the high initial cost of
implementation, particularly for retrofitting existing buildings with legacy systems. These
costs can deter stakeholders from investing in necessary infrastructure upgrades, especially
when the return on investment is not immediately evident. The literature identifies several
key factors influencing the adoption of data-driven technologies in smart buildings, which
can be categorized into social factors, individual perceptions, cost considerations, security
and privacy concerns, and data quality and relevance. Table 7 summarizes these influential
factors and their corresponding references.

5.1.1. Social Factors
Social factors significantly influence individuals’ decisions to adopt new technologies,
particularly in group or societal contexts. These factors encompass trust, social influence,
behavioral intention, hedonic motivation, soft skills, and well-being.
Trust plays a crucial role in technological adoption. Users are more likely to embrace
data-driven technologies when they trust the technology itself and the entities providing
it [78–80]. Trust can be established through transparent communication, reliable perfor-
mance, and robust security measures.
Social influence refers to the impact of others’ opinions and behaviors on an indi-
vidual’s decision to adopt technology [81]. If peers, family members, or influential fig-
ures endorse or use a particular technology, individuals may feel more inclined to adopt
it themselves.
Behavioral intention is the degree to which an individual plans to use technology,
influenced by attitudes and subjective norms [80]. Positive behavioral intentions, shaped
by favorable attitudes and perceived social pressure, often lead to higher adoption rates.
Hedonic motivation involves the enjoyment or pleasure derived from using technol-
ogy [80]. When users find technology engaging or entertaining, they are more likely to
adopt it due to the intrinsic satisfaction it provides.
Soft skills, such as interpersonal and intrapersonal abilities, can impact technology
adoption. A lack of soft skills among users may hinder the adoption of data-driven
technologies [51]. For instance, inadequate communication skills or resistance to change
can impede the effective implementation of new systems.
Well-being considerations influence adoption when technologies are perceived to
enhance users’ quality of life [79]. Technologies that contribute to health, comfort, or
convenience are more likely to be embraced by users seeking to improve their well-being.
5.1.2. Individual Perceptions
Individual perceptions about technology’s attributes significantly affect decisions for
its adoption. Factors such as perceived usefulness, ease of use, innovation, compatibility,
perceived value, and risk perception are critical.
Perceived usefulness and ease of use are foundational elements in technology accep-
tance models [78,82]. Users are more inclined to adopt technologies that they believe will
enhance their performance or efficiency and that are easy to learn and operate. For example,
if a smart home system simplifies household management without requiring extensive
effort when using it, adoption likelihood increases.
Perceived innovation reflects the degree to which technology is seen as new or
novel [78]. Users may be attracted to innovative technologies that offer advanced fea-
tures or capabilities beyond existing solutions.

Energies 2025, 18, 290
23 of 52
Compatibility refers to how well a type of technology aligns with users’ existing
values, needs, and past experiences [82,85]. Technologies that fit seamlessly into users’
lifestyles or work practices are more readily adopted. For instance, an energy management
system that integrates with existing appliances and devices may be more appealing.
Perceived value involves the overall assessment of technology’s benefits relative to
its costs [84]. Users weigh the advantages, such as energy savings or convenience, against
the financial expenses and effort required. A high perceived value enhances the likelihood
of adoption.
Risk perception encompasses concerns about potential negative outcomes, such as
security breaches, privacy violations, or technical failures [80]. High levels of perceived
risk can deter users from adopting new technologies. Addressing these concerns through
risk mitigation strategies is essential.
Effort expectancy is the perceived ease associated with using the technology [80].
Technologies requiring minimal effort and complexity are more attractive to users who
may be reluctant to invest significant time and energy into learning new systems.
Human detachment concerns relate to worries about reduced human interaction or
over-reliance on technology [83]. Users may fear that automation could lead to isolation or
diminished personal connections, affecting their willingness to adopt such technologies.
5.1.3. Cost Considerations
Cost is a significant factor influencing the adoption of data-driven technologies. High
initial investment costs, ongoing maintenance expenses, and the perceived affordability
of technology can either facilitate or hinder adoption [83,85]. The cost of implementing
Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled HVAC systems can vary significantly depending on
factors such as the size of the building, the complexity of the system, and regional pricing.
Estimates suggest that such systems may require substantial upfront investments, especially
for large-scale commercial buildings [88]. Retrofitting older buildings further increases
costs due to compatibility issues and the required infrastructure updates.
Studies indicate that the cost of implementing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in
smart homes can be a barrier [85]. Users may hesitate to invest in expensive systems without
clear evidence of long-term benefits or return on investment. Conversely, advancements in
technology, increased market competition, and economies of scale can reduce costs over
time, making data-driven technologies more accessible. However, these expenses must
be weighed against long-term savings in energy costs, which can range from 20% to 40%
annually [89], enabling a return on investment within 5 to 10 years, depending on the scale
of implementation and available subsidies [90].
The trade-offs between cost and comfort are particularly critical. For instance, adaptive
HVAC systems dynamically balance energy efficiency with thermal comfort, which is
assessed using metrics such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percentage
Dissatisfied (PPD). Systems must also meet indoor air quality (IAQ) standards, which
mandate minimum ventilation rates (e.g., 8.5 L per second per occupant in offices per
the ASHRAE Standard 62.1) [91]. Perceived economic benefits, such as energy savings
and operational efficiencies, can offset cost concerns. When users recognize that the
long-term savings outweigh the initial expenses, they may be more willing to adopt the
technology [83].
Additionally, regulatory compliance adds complexity to cost considerations. Many
regions enforce stringent energy codes, such as the EU Energy Performance of Build-
ings Directive or the U.S. ASHRAE 90.1 standard [92], which mandate minimum energy
performance levels while ensuring occupant health and comfort. HVAC systems are de-

Energies 2025, 18, 290
24 of 52
signed to optimize energy efficiency while adhering to these mandatory constraints, further
emphasizing the cost–compliance–comfort trade-off.
5.1.4. Security and Privacy Concerns
Security and privacy are paramount in the adoption of data-driven technologies. Users
must feel confident that their personal information is protected and that technology does
not expose them to undue risks.
Security risks involve fears of cyber threats, hacking, and unauthorized access to
systems [86]. Users may worry about the vulnerability of smart building systems to
cyber-attacks, which could compromise safety or lead to data breaches.
Privacy risks pertain to concerns about how personal data are collected, stored, and
used [83,84]. Users are cautious about technologies that may infringe on their privacy by
sharing sensitive information without consent.
Safety concerns relate to the potential physical risks associated with technology
use [86]. For example, malfunctioning automated systems could pose hazards within
a smart building environment.
Addressing these concerns requires implementing robust security measures, transpar-
ent data policies, and compliance with regulations. Enhancing user education about how
data are protected can build trust and facilitate adoption [79].
5.1.5. Data Quality and Relevance
The effectiveness and reliability of data-driven technologies depend on the quality
and security of the data they utilize. However, increased connectivity and reliance on
IoT devices expose smart buildings to cybersecurity threats. Unauthorized access or data
breaches not only compromise sensitive information but also impact trust among users.
Poor data management practices exacerbate these risks, potentially leading to inaccurate
insights and reduced satisfaction with the technology [87].
Inaccurate or irrelevant data can result from faulty sensors, data entry errors, or
inadequate data processing methods. When users receive incorrect information or insights,
they may lose confidence in the technology’s usefulness.
Inaccurate outcomes stemming from poor data can hinder decision-making processes
and operational efficiency [87]. For instance, in Building Energy Management, inaccurate
data analytics may lead to suboptimal energy usage recommendations, negating the benefits
of technology.
Enhancing data quality involves ensuring accurate data collection, employing reliable
data processing techniques, and providing transparent analytics. By improving data
integrity, stakeholders can enhance the perceived usefulness of data-driven technologies,
encouraging adoption.
5.2. Business Models Supporting the Adoption of Data-Driven Technologies

Appendix B.1. Search Strategy
The search strategy was tailored for each of the selected databases (Scopus, Web of
Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library) using the following principles:
•
Keyword Selection: keywords reflected the review’s focus areas, such as “smart
buildings”, “energy optimization”, “Big Data”, “Artificial Intelligence”, and “adop-
tion barriers.”
•
Boolean Operators: logical operators (e.g., AND, OR) were used to create structured
and efficient search strings.
•
Filters: language- (English) and document-type (journal articles and conference papers)
filters were applied to ensure relevance and manageability.
•
Database Syntax Adaptation: search strings were adapted to meet the requirements
and functionalities of each database.
Domain experts reviewed the search strategy for coverage and scope. Pilot searches
were conducted to assess the string’s effectiveness and ensure relevant results. Adjustments
were made based on the test results to improve precision and recall.
The following primary search string was used:
(“smart” OR “intelligent” OR “connected” OR “automated” OR “energy” OR “load”
OR “electricity” OR “district heating”) AND (“building” OR “home” OR “office”) AND
(“Big Data” OR “data analytics” OR “data mining” OR “predictive analytics” OR “Ar-

tificial Intelligence” OR “AI” OR “machine learning” OR “deep learning” OR “natural
language processing” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT” OR “connected devices” OR
“sensor networks” OR “digital twin” OR “virtual models” OR “cyber-physical systems”
OR “blockchain” OR “cloud computing” OR “edge computing”) AND (“adoption” OR
“implementation” OR “utilization” OR “barrier” OR “challenge” OR “obstacle” OR “in-
centive” OR “motivation” OR “potential” OR “opportunit*” OR “business” OR “value”
OR “innovation”).
Each database’s specific syntax and search functionalities were considered, and search
filters were applied to include only publications in English and relevant document types
(articles and conference papers).
Appendix B.2. Study Selection
The study selection process followed a structured, multi-step approach to ensure
transparency, rigor, and alignment with the scoping following review’s objectives:
(1)
Identification
The automated search conducted using AutoResearch (see Search Strategy) yielded a
total of 410 records from four databases: Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM
Digital Library. References were exported into reference management software (EndNote),
where duplicates were identified and removed, resulting in 323 unique records.
(2)
Screening
Titles and abstracts of the remaining records were screened independently by two
reviewers using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, as shown in Table A2.
During this phase, 129 records were excluded, leaving 194 studies for full-text assessment.
(3)
Eligibility Assessment
The full texts of 129 studies were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. Twenty-one
records were excluded due to missing full texts or a lack of relevance to the research scope.
In total, 61 additional records were excluded after full-text review because they did not
meet the inclusion criteria (e.g., they focused on unrelated topics or included insufficient
discussion of data-driven technologies). Among the included articles, 33 were identified
as review articles, which are distinct in focus and type compared to other research papers.
These review articles were analyzed separately due to their different objectives and method-
ologies, providing synthesized insights into overarching themes and research gaps rather
than case-specific findings. In contrast, primary research papers were examined for specific
results, methodologies, and contextual details.
(4)
Final Inclusion:
A total of 112 studies were included in the final synthesis. These studies were cate-
gorized thematically based on energy optimization strategies, building types, and data-
driven technologies.
(5)
Reviewer Consensus:
The process was conducted collaboratively by two independent reviewers. Discrep-
ancies between reviewers during the title, abstract, and full-text screening stages were
resolved through discussion. If agreement could not be reached, a third reviewer was
consulted to make the final decision.

Table A2. Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.
Inclusion Criteria
Exclusion Criteria
-
Studies focusing on data-driven technologies in
smart buildings.
-
Research discussing energy optimization strategies
or adoption factors.
-
Peer-reviewed journal articles and conference
papers published in English.
-
Studies unrelated to smart buildings or data-driven
technologies.
-
Non-peer-reviewed literature (e.g., editorials,
opinion pieces, abstracts without full texts).
-
Duplicates or inaccessible records.
The selection process was documented comprehensively, and a PRISMA flow diagram
(Figure 2) was used to visually illustrate the number of records at each stage of the selection
process, including the reasons for exclusion.
Appendix B.3. Data Charting, Management, and Items
Data extraction and management were conducted meticulously to ensure a compre-
hensive and accurate synthesis of the literature. All the reviewed articles, including their
abstracts and full texts, were downloaded and imported into the reference management
software EndNote. EndNote facilitated the organization, annotation, and retrieval of ar-
ticles throughout the review process, enabling the efficient handling of a large volume
of studies.
A standardized data extraction form was developed to systematically collect the
relevant information from each included study (as shown in Table A3). The data extraction
focused on the following key elements:
•
Study focus: the main topics and objectives of the study were identified, such as
specific data-driven technologies implemented in smart buildings, energy optimization
strategies, or aspects of business models and adoption factors.
•
Methodology: the research design and methods used were documented during the
study, including data collection techniques (e.g., experiments, simulations, case studies,
surveys), analytical approaches, and any models or frameworks applied.
•
Key findings: the principal results, conclusions, and recommendations were extracted
relating to data-driven technologies, energy optimization, business models, and influ-
ential factors affecting their adoption in smart buildings.

Reviewer Preparation
-
Two reviewers were prepared to use the data charting form consistently across studies.
-
This preparation focused on achieving alignment in data interpretation and minimizing
discrepancies.
Charting Process
-
Each study was charted independently by two reviewers using the standardized form.
-
Extracted data were compared between reviewers to identify and resolve discrepancies
through discussion.
-
If disagreements persisted, a third reviewer was consulted to make the final decision.
Iterative Refinement
-
The data charting form and process were iteratively refined based on feedback during
the initial stages to address ambiguities or gaps in data extraction.
-
Additional categories were added as needed to capture emerging themes or
information relevant to the review objectives.
Data Management
-
All charted data were organized and stored in a central database using reference
management software (e.g., EndNote) and spreadsheet software for analysis.
-
Meta-data, including notes on methodological rigor or study limitations, were recorded
to provide context during synthesis.
Quality Assurance
-
A final round of the review was conducted to ensure the completeness and accuracy of
the extracted data across all included studies.
This scoping review identified and extracted key data items from the included studies
to address research objectives and provide a comprehensive overview of the field. The data
items shown in Table A4 were systematically charted.
