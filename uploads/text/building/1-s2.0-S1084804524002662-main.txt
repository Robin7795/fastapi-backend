This study addresses the growing challenges of energy consumption and the depletion of energy resources,
particularly in the context of smart buildings. As the demand for energy increases alongside the need for efficient
building maintenance, it becomes imperative to explore innovative energy management solutions. We present a
review of Internet of Things (IoT)-based frameworks aimed at managing smart city energy consumption, the
pivotal role of IoT devices in addressing these issues due to their compactness, sensing, measurement, and
computing capabilities. Our review methodology involves a thorough analysis of existing literature on IoT ar-
chitectures and frameworks for intelligent energy management applications. We focus on systems that not only
collect and store data but also support intelligent analysis for monitoring, controlling, and enhancing system
efficiency. Additionally, we examine the potential for these frameworks to serve as platforms for the develop-
ment of third-party applications, thereby extending their utility and adaptability. The findings from our review
indicate that IoT-based frameworks offer potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact in
smart buildings. By adopting intelligent mechanisms and solutions, these frameworks facilitate effective energy
management, leading to improved system efficiency and sustainability. Considering these findings, we recom-
mend further exploration and adoption of IoT-based wireless sensing systems in smart buildings as a strategic
approach to energy management. Our review highlights the importance of incorporating intelligent analysis and
enabling the development of third-party applications within the IoT framework to efficiently meet evolving
energy demands and maintenance challenges.
1. Introduction
The rapid increase in global energy demand, driven by population
growth and urbanization, presents an urgent challenge for sustainable
development. As cities expand and energy consumption soars, efficient
energy management becomes critical to mitigating environmental im-
pacts and ensuring reliable energy supply. In this context, smart cities
offer a promising solution, leveraging advanced technologies such as the
Internet of Things (IoT) to automate energy production, distribution,
and consumption. However, the existing energy infrastructure is often
inefficient,
leading
to
significant
waste
and
resource
depletion.
Addressing these inefficiencies through intelligent, IoT-based frame-
works is vital for achieving sustainability and energy resilience in the
modern urban landscape. Despite the growing need for energy for a
nation’s economic development, global population growth, as well as for
society’s way of life, the worldwide energy demand has risen substan-
tially (Ashraf, 2021a). The use of wide-area monitoring and smart me-

transmission, distribution, and consumption at multiple levels. By
measuring the electrical properties of the transmission system and uti-
lizing universal timestamps, it becomes possible to accurately predict
measurement precision, identify faults, and isolate them effectively.
This enhances the reliability of the transmission grid. However, grid
distribution and usage differ in terms of the level of automation. Ad-
vancements in the IoT have played a crucial role in further automating
these processes and controlling systems more efficiently (Ruiz-Zafra
et al., 2022). Sustainability is the use of energy efficiently while meeting
the demands of the modern world. Ecological, social, and economic
concerns can all be addressed through sustainable energy. Sustainable
energy management may involve utilizing renewable resources in the
best possible way, leveraging sustainable energy resources, utilizing
alternative energy resources, integrating IoT solutions, and applying
green technology. Incorporating new technologies into existing opera-
tions is the goal of a smart system. Smart systems extract information
about a city’s utility system and traffic flow using sensors. These systems
analyze information patterns for forecasting. An IoT system sends data
through a network without requiring human-to-human interaction.
Green technology refers to technologies that build environmentally
friendly products by combining science and technology. In addition to
purifying water, preserving natural resources, producing clean energy,
and recycling garbage, green technologies are also used. Interconnected
digital and mechanical machinery, things, and computer devices also
use this technology.
Sustainable energy systems include intelligent grids, intelligent cit-
ies, and intelligent transportation systems. Implementing a sustainable
energy system is not limited to large-scale techniques; emailing and
texting without using paper can also reduce paper consumption. Both of
these contribute to sustainable energy development. It is a formidable
task for the government to generate and distribute energy to a growing
population. Energy consumption has increased due to a growing popu-
lation, resulting in several environmental and health concerns. There-
fore, creating and utilizing energy resources effectively is crucial. The
implementation of a sustainable energy system entails three primary
phases, according to Goncalves and Santos (Ashraf, 2021a). They are 1)
to analyze energy management policies at the industrial level; 2) to
debate ways to implement sustainable energy; and 3) to examine the
best ways to use sustainable energy once it has been validated by in-
ternational experts (Ashraf, 2021b). Recent years have seen dramatic
growth in the number of smart gadgets, which is soon likely to surpass
billions. This is owing to the proliferation of IoT technologies across all
industries. In smart networks, there are mainly IoT systems composed of
networked devices, such as smartphones, sensors, automobiles, and so
on. As part of sustainable energy management, smart grids are one of the
solutions. This can be explained in part by introducing smart, autono-
mous, and bidirectional power grids (Ruiz-Zafra et al., 2022). Threat-
ening the environment and working against green technology and
carbon emission reductions, these tactics have a negative effect on the
environment. They are designed mainly for the benefit of corporations
and governments. Historically, most energy meters have been analog.
Errors, operational losses, and theft were common. Most of the time, the
defect cannot be diagnosed properly, and it cannot be corrected. As a
result, the smart meter facilitated communication between the meter,
the grid, and the user (Zhao et al., 2022). The expansion of macro data
and the evolution of IoT technology play a crucial role in making smart
cities possible. Using high-end network services, metadata can provide
valuable insights into large volumes of data collected from a variety of
sources, and the IoT has enabled sensor integration, radio frequency,
and Bluetooth detection in the real world. Combining metadata with the
IoT is an unexplored research area that can be used to reach the smart
city of the future while presenting new and exciting challenges (Rahimi
et al., 2020; Songhorabadi et al., 2020, 2023). In smart cities, several
technologies are used to increase citizen comfort levels in areas such as
transportation, energy, education, etc. This also includes reducing costs
and using resources in addition to promoting active and effective citizen
participation (Das, 2022). A recent technology that plays an important
role in increasing smart city services is metadata analysis. In smart cities,
smart buildings, smart healthcare, and smart industrial applications, IoT
use BD technology to deploy tiny sensors for wireless communication.
The need for a definition of building energy use grows as more projects
and technologies address this issue (Mukherjee et al., 2020). It is
necessary to evaluate how a building functions to determine how much
energy it consumes. The energy consumption of residential buildings is
mainly affected by the indoor comfort services provided to individuals,
whereas the energy consumption of industrial buildings is largely
determined by industrial machinery and manufacturing infrastructure.
Integrating and developing systems based on Information and Commu-
nication Technologies, and, the IoT, facilitates a wide array of applica-
tions and makes smart buildings a reality (Uzair et al., 2019; Egri and
V´ancza, 2013). Data and knowledge from the real world are effectively
absorbed into the digital realm through IoT and communication be-
tween intelligent objects. Their study evaluates the effectiveness of
IoT-based frameworks in managing energy within smart cities, specif-
ically evaluating the impact of these technologies on reducing energy
consumption and reducing environmental impacts in smart buildings.
They aim to identify and advocate for solutions that enhance system
efficiency and sustainability by reviewing IoT architectures and frame-
works designed for intelligent energy management. This study high-
lights key challenges, such as the interoperability of IoT devices, data
security, and the scalability of systems across diverse urban environ-
ments. Our original contributions include the development of a frame-
work for integrating third-party applications, enabling adaptive energy
management in smart cities. We address the gaps in existing literature by
proposing solutions that not only optimize energy usage but also ensure
system flexibility and resilience in evolving energy landscapes. It focuses
on the implementation of advanced algorithms and technologies that are
capable of autonomously analyzing, predicting, and managing energy
consumption in smart buildings and cities. Using machine learning,
artificial intelligence (AI), and the IoT, these mechanisms are capable of
monitoring and controlling energy consumption to optimize efficiency
and reduce waste. Incorporating ML into energy management enables
dynamic adjustments to supply and demand, reducing energy waste
while ensuring a steady and reliable power supply. As these algorithms
learn from historical data, they can detect anomalies and automatically
adjust to changing conditions, such as variations in user behavior or
environmental factors. Additionally, ML facilitates the integration of
renewable energy sources by predicting their availability and incorpo-
rating them into the grid efficiently. In smart buildings, ML systems can
autonomously control heating, cooling, and lighting based on real-time
data from sensors, further enhancing energy efficiency. These advanced
systems minimize human intervention by autonomously monitoring and
adjusting energy usage, leading to cost reductions and a smaller envi-
ronmental footprint. Ultimately, ML-powered IoT frameworks foster
smarter, more sustainable urban energy systems, contributing to overall
energy efficiency and environmental conservation. These solutions are
capable of forecasting energy demand, adapting to user behavior, and
seamlessly integrating renewable energy sources through the integra-
tion of data from various sensors and devices. As a result of this
approach, not only do energy systems operate more efficiently, but also
the environmental impact of energy consumption is minimized. In the
field of energy management, the solutions are unique in that they are
capable of learning from data, making informed decisions, and
dynamically

The availability of smart gadgets with sensing and interaction ca-
pabilities, as well as recognition technologies, enables the collection of
unprecedented amounts of actual environmental information. As
described in this article, we propose an infrastructure for a smart city
that is based on the concept of the digital city and integrates the IoT to
control energy consumption. Three different methods were used to
analyze the data in this study. To examine the various components of the

smart grid (where such solutions (and results) can be applied, with a
focus on smart city energy management), applications in the field of IoT
and nearby are examined. After reviewing the research literature, a
generalized set of existing solutions is developed; these include the key
features identified during the literature review. Our study evaluates the
effectiveness of IoT-based frameworks in managing energy within smart
cities, specifically evaluating the impact of these technologies on
reducing energy consumption and reducing environmental impacts in
smart buildings. We aim to identify and advocate for solutions that
enhance system efficiency and sustainability as well as support the
integration and development of third-party applications to address
evolving energy demands by reviewing IoT architectures and frame-
works designed for intelligent energy management.

rent technologies.

2. Literature review
In our literature review, we applied a systematic approach to ensure
a rigorous analysis of relevant studies. We began by identifying key
search terms related to IoT, energy management, smart cities, and sus-
tainability. Databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Google
Scholar were searched using these terms. Our inclusion criteria focused
on peer-reviewed articles published in the last decade, prioritizing
studies that specifically addressed IoT applications in energy manage-
ment within urban environments. We also considered papers that pro-
posed practical frameworks or provided empirical data on energy
efficiency and sustainability in smart buildings. Studies were selected
based on their relevance, methodological soundness, and contribution to
the field. To ensure objectivity, the selected literature was analyzed
using a structured framework that categorized studies by their focus
areas, including IoT architectures, energy optimization techniques,
machine learning applications, and sustainability impacts. Justifying
these choices, our goal was to capture a broad spectrum of current ad-
vancements while also identifying critical gaps in the existing body of
research. This process strengthened the rigor of our review by ensuring
that the most relevant and high-impact studies were included for
analysis.
There is a detailed discussion in this section of prior studies on IoT-
based energy management in smart buildings, exploring various
frameworks and their contributions to reducing energy consumption,
with references to key works reported in the field. Zakik et al. (Mancini
et al., 2020) in a study entitled Machine Learning System based on
public sector energy efficiency management as a smart city approach.
The purpose of this paper is to address the question of how Big Data
operating systems and machine learning can be integrated into an
intelligent system for managing public sector energy efficiency as an
integral part of smart city concepts. Wang et al. (Zeki´c-Suˇsac et al.,
2021) conducted a case study and developed optimization algorithms
for a home energy management system based on the IoT. To demon-
strate the value of the proposed technique, the results of multi-objective
optimization are compared with those of Particle swarm optimization
(PSO)-based and Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA)-based algo-
rithms. To evaluate system performance, the simulation results are
compared with those of a normal home energy management system. In
their study, Sadeeq et al. (Wang et al., 2021) considered energy man-
agement within IoT systems. A review of the literature and policy
analysis related to aggregators of energy management systems and end
users in affiliate systems is discussed in this article. Silva et al. (Sadeeq
and Zeebaree, 2021) conducted a study entitled Using Big Data Analysis
and Smart Web Architecture to Provide Efficient Services and Energy
Management. To improve the network performance of a proposed smart
city design, researchers have created an IoT and Web of Things inte-
grated smart building architecture (smart house). In a study entitled
Object-Based Energy Management, Shafik et al. (Silva et al., 2020)
addressed the challenges and solutions associated with smart cities. An
in-depth analysis of the proper management of the object-based Internet
in smart cities is presented in this study. In this study, it is demonstrated
that the IoT has increased energy consumption, and the summary study
illustrates the latest proposed methods in energy management across
different belts such as smart homes, smart buildings, and smart grids.
In addition, Jiang et al. (Shafik et al., 2020) conducted a study on
IoT-based smart city information system building and cloud computing.
This study illustrates that this system can share information sharing,
exchange, and fusion between different sensing subsystems, thereby
solving the problem of previous information islands and serving the real
needs of smart cities. According to Golpira et al. (Jiang, 2020), a study
called Optimized Urban Intelligent Management based on IoT while
accounting for movable loads and energy savings was conducted. An
IoT-based energy management framework for IoT-based public distri-
bution networks is presented in this paper using a complex integer linear
programming problem. Golpira et al. (Golpîra and Bahramara, 2020)
conducted a study titled Optimized Urban Intelligent Management
based on the IoT for Movable Loads and Energy Savings. An IoT-based
energy management framework is proposed for IoT-based public dis-
tribution networks in smart cities (SC) by posing a new complex integer
linear programming problem. Naranjo et al. (2019) investigated City
Smart Network Architecture using Fog for managing IoT applications.
According to the simulation results of the selected case study, the
energy-efficient solution provided by FOCAN impacts the communica-
tion performance of different objects within smart cities. Sodhro et al.

duced the Hybrid Adaptive Bandwidth and Power Algorithm (HABPA)
and Delay-tolerant Streaming Algorithm (DSA) to enhance multimedia
transmission performance. Using the video stream StarWarsIV, their
analysis focused on metrics like power usage, battery life, delay, stan-
dard deviation, and packet loss ratio (PLR). HABPA showed better re-
sults than DSA and a baseline model, reducing power drain by 45%,
improving battery life by 37%, and achieving a lower PLR of 4.5% and
standard deviation of 3.5 dB. These findings demonstrate HABPA’s

potential to optimize energy efficiency and resource use in IoT devices,
supporting smarter, more sustainable city operations. Kabalchi et al.
(Kabalci et al., 2019) examined IoT applications for intelligent grids and
smart environments. Additionally, the authors discussed obstacles,
unanswered questions, and future research prospects for IoT-based EI
applications, as well as several crucial study areas. Creating an Intelli-
gent and Sustainable Environment Using the IoT was the title of a study
conducted by Tyagi et al. (Tyagi, 2019). Due to rapid technological
advancements (in the last two decades), the Internet has improved the
means/means of human life. Today, smart cities or environments are
essential for any government, anywhere in the world. An IoT network
based on blockchain-based secure device management has been pub-
lished by Gang et al. (Gong et al., 2019). As a result of this article’s
framework, devices will be able to be managed confidentially and reli-
ably within a smart city network, and the integrity, controllability,
compatibility, and validation of each device will be provided, along with
an analysis of the framework’s efficacy. Their research draws upon these
foundational works to propose a unique integration strategy that le-
verages IoT for real-time, adaptive energy management, setting the
stage for a scalable smart city framework. This strategic approach aims
to resolve the practical and operational inefficiencies identified in pre-
vious studies, thereby catalyzing the evolution from theoretical models
to actionable, impactful urban energy solutions.
Yu et al. (2019) developed a smart energy management system based
on IoT in a city. Results show that the IoT-based intelligent city energy
management system can satisfy the "smart city" construction needs. It
integrates isolated energy information and measures energy consump-
tion. Based on this, energy savings in urban energy consumption can be
identified and evaluated. A study conducted by Javid et al. (Iqbal et al.,
2018) is titled The General Architecture of the Internet to Control
Electricity Consumption in Smart Homes. By using the Hadoop
ecosystem, data is also processed in real-time to maximize productivity
and minimize processing time. Alavi et al. (2018) published a study
titled Smart Cities equipped with the IoT: The most advanced and future
trends. In addition, an IoT-based prototype is presented to illustrate how
civilian
infrastructure
can
be
monitored
in
real-time
using
a
cost-effective IoT-based prototype. Their final section discusses the
challenges and future directions of IoT-based smart city applications.
According to Zhang et al. (Campos et al., 2016) big data analytics can be
used to develop smart city infrastructure. This study proposes measures,
including rational planning of city infrastructure, the creation and
improvement of performance mechanisms, and city management per-
formance. Based on the results, the proposed system is more scalable and
efficient than existing systems. In addition, the system performance is
measured in terms of performance and processing time. Barto et al. (Liu
et al., 2019) presented SIGINURB, an IoT-based smart city system. A
hybrid system using cloud data processing analysis for the development
of smart cities and urban planning is proposed in this study to address
the challenges associated with smart cities. The purpose of the system is
to create a variety of applications that provide new services to students,
employees, companies, and government managers at the University of
So Paulo, and improve their quality of life. Liu et al. (Ejaz et al., 2017)
Designed an IoT-based energy management system based on cloud
computing infrastructure in a smart city. An overview of Internet-based
energy management in smart cities is provided in this study. then pro-
pose a framework and software model for an Internet-based system with
cloud computing. Finally, the researchers suggest a planning scheme
that is energy efficient. They also demonstrate its effectiveness.
According to Ejaz et al. (Sato et al., 2019), the increase in car use
calls for innovative solutions to improve living conditions and trans-
portation. The IoT connects diverse devices and systems to create
intelligent cities. As the number and needs of IoT devices continue to
grow, so does their energy consumption. Therefore, intelligent city so-
lutions must be able to use energy efficiently and address the associated
challenges. Extending the lifespan of low-power products through
intelligent city energy harvesting is becoming increasingly popular.
Initially, this approach focuses on programming energy-efficient smart
homes, followed by wireless power distribution in smart cities for the
IoT. However, a drawback is the high cost of power. In the past decade,
real-time data sets were applied to traditional regression models
(Charytoniuk et al., 1998), (Gezer et al., 2015), with forecasts recorded
afterward. Neural networks were subsequently used for prediction, as
described in (Fallah et al., 2018). In this project, a simulation route
mimics multi-layered feedforward networks, and the system’s perfor-
mance has been reported to be exceptional. In an extensive study on IoT,
Reka and Dragicevic (2018) found that intelligent grid techniques could
improve energy efficiency. IoT offers numerous advantages for energy
management, based on factors such as energy efficiency, security,
functionality, and sustainability (Mortaji et al., 2017). Asgari et al.
(2024) analyze sustainable welfare dynamics using GDP threshold ef-
fects and Granger causality. The study reveals that short-term economic
growth drives energy consumption under certain GDP thresholds, while
long-term impacts vary, the need for differentiated economic strategies
based on GDP levels to achieve sustainability goals.
In (Zhang et al., 2021) developed a method for analyzing time series
load data by using auto-regressive integrated moving averages. Using
forecasting, this effort seeks to reduce the peak-to-average ratio so that
an intelligent IoT setup can be managed directly. To anticipate
non-seasonal and seasonal data loads (Alberg and Last, 2017), suggests
using an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average. In (Ouyang et al.,
2017) developed a technique for forecasting short-term load. This is a
data-driven design derived from a belief network with copula stages.
The deep neural network technique and extreme learning machines are
interrelated. In (Chen et al., 2019) developed an improved short-term
prediction model based on deep residual networks. To improve the
effectiveness of the system, a two-stage ensemble approach was devel-
oped. In (Ahmad et al., 2017) presented an Accurate and Fast
Converging Short-Term Load Forecasting setup that includes a predic-
tor, an optimizer, and a feature selector. It is available for common in-
dustrial SG applications, including load switching, infrastructure
maintenance, contract evaluation, energy production planning, and
power procurement. Short-term load forecasts are required in the elec-
tric sector of the energy market. Electric utilities use these models as part
of their daily operations for evaluating contracts, performing infra-
structure maintenance, planning power production, and shifting loads.
Time series data may be selected based on various features (Li et al.,
2017; Priyan and Devi, 2018). All data sets are purged of duplicates
before being input into the neural network that anticipates the
contraction of electricity in the next few days. The authors also provide a
way to overcome numerous hurdles and difficulties in load prediction
setup (Wazid et al., 2017). To categorize this issue, we discover multiple
hybrid techniques based on Computational intelligence. As opposed to
Computational intelligence load prediction techniques, which are
structured methodological approaches intended for prediction situa-
tions, the associated technology is a specific model that, along with
other associated models such as regression and neural networks, is
grouped into one technological category. Li et al. (Gao et al., 2020)
developed an IoT-based technique for load prediction. Next, a two-step
technique of prediction was developed, which provides more accurate
predictions than conventional methods. In (Murugan and Devi, 2019;
Senthil Murugan and Usha Devi, 2018) designed a hybrid model for
analyzing massive amounts of data for use in a variety of studies. In
(Maaji et al., 2018) developed a method to improve voltage stability
using machine learning. For optimal results, both Naive Bayes and
K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers should be used. Rafiei et al. (2018)
developed a hybrid approach that integrates probabilistic load predic-
tion with massive learning machines. The proposed system divides
electricity expansion into a series of well-behaved and productive sub-
series using wavelet transformation. An optimization strategy based on
swarms was proposed in (Zeng et al., 2017) to predict short-term load.

method, each swarm functions independently, just like in a normal PSO,
to simulate natural selection. ELMs are among the most prevalent hid-
den layer feedforward networks. Compared to standard artificial
learning approaches, they offer greater generalization. By eliminating
the unnecessary hidden nodes and training difficulties, the selected
route can give excellent results. In (Das, 2022), the energy renewal of
current building practices was evaluated as a cornerstone of the Italian
energy strategy. The primary objective of the system is to conserve en-
ergy and ensure the effective use of resources through optimized
ventilation, air conditioning, and heating. The research focuses on
analyzing energy consumption, Indoor Environmental Quality, and the
impact of varying airflow rates, utilizing both in situ measurements and
dynamic simulations. While the system reduces energy usage, it is noted
that it may increase carbon dioxide levels by up to 42% (Kaur et al.,
2021). Ya˘g et al. (Ya˘g and Altan, 2022) proposed intelligent energy
management solutions that employ sophisticated mechanisms, such as
machine learning and artificial intelligence, to maximize energy effi-
ciency and sustainability in smart environments. In the study, efficiency
encompasses multiple dimensions of IoT-based energy management in
smart cities: optimizing energy utilization to minimize waste, improving
operational performance to automate and enhance system responsive-
ness, reducing energy costs through effective demand and peak load
management, and minimizing environmental impacts by lowering
emissions associated with energy consumption. Efficiency also covers
the optimal allocation of resources, ensuring that both technological and
human assets are utilized effectively to achieve sustainable urban
development. The related work based on the last study is shown in
Table 1.
We explore various studies exploring the integration of IoT tech-
nologies into energy management systems within smart buildings and
cities in the literature review. These studies demonstrate the trans-
formative potential of IoT-based solutions. These works reveal key
themes, including the implementation of machine learning and big data
analytics to optimize energy consumption, the creation of sophisticated
algorithms for energy management in the home and public sector, and
the development of smart city architecture. Through intelligent analysis
and real-time data processing, these investigations demonstrated how
IoT technologies can effectively reduce energy consumption and envi-
ronmental impact. Literature reveals a trend toward IoT framework
adoption that facilitates energy management and promotes the devel-
opment of third-party applications, thus enhancing the adaptability and
utility of smart systems. Scalable, flexible solutions that can adapt to
changing
energy
demands
and
technological
advancements
are
becoming increasingly important. The critical analysis of these studies
places the research within a broader context of IoT applications. As well
as the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, it outlines innovative
approaches and technological advancements. Comparison and contrast
of previous research can help us better understand how IoT-based sys-
tems can address energy consumption and sustainability issues in smart
environments. IoT capabilities and their impact on smart city infra-
structure are examined in this study, reinforcing the significance of the
study and guiding future research. In the study, we utilized an analytical
approach to assess the effectiveness of IoT-based frameworks for energy
management in smart cities. The analysis began with descriptive ana-
lytics to summarize baseline energy usage from IoT device data, fol-
lowed by predictive analytics using machine learning algorithms like
regression analysis and neural networks to forecast future energy de-
mands. We then applied prescriptive analytics with optimization models
such as linear programming to suggest actionable energy management
strategies. Simulation models tested the feasibility of these strategies
under various conditions, while data fusion techniques integrated
diverse data sources for an energy overview. Additionally, system dy-
namics models assessed long-term impacts on urban infrastructure, and
real-time monitoring and control ensured optimal system performance
by responding immediately to any changes in energy usage. Each
method played a critical role in providing a thorough understanding of

the operational efficiencies and strategic decision-making necessary for
sustainable urban development.
2.1. Components of smart cities
The components of a smart city are shown in Fig. 1. A smart city
application starts with data gathering, then transmits and receives data,
stores data, and analyzes the data. In several sectors, sensor develop-
ment has been driven by the requirement to collect data. The second step
is the transmission of data from the data collection devices to the cloud
for analysis and storage. There have been many smart-city initiatives
that have included citywide Wi-Fi networks, 4G and 5G technology, as
well as local networks that can send and receive data locally or globally.
In preparation for the fourth step, data analysis, cloud storage is the
third phase, which incorporates numerous storage options. The analysis
of data helps in making decisions by finding patterns and conclusions.
There may be circumstances in which simple analyses, such as
decision-making and aggregation, are appropriate. Cloud computing
makes it possible not only to gather, save, and process data, but also to
analyze it in real-time utilizing deep learning algorithms and machine
learning algorithms (Songhorabadi et al., 2020) (see Table 2).
2.2. IoT definition in smart devices
Intelligent devices will combine sensor data from several sources,
determine the best course of action based on local and distributed in-
formation, and then change or manage the environment. By utilizing
computing resources, storage, and interlayer communications, such as
cloud computing, cloud storage, and other current Internet technologies,
objects can operate in the physical realm and provide enhanced robotic
services. Cloud data transmission speeds provide robot mobility and
functionality, allowing jobs to be transferred without severe restrictions.

links to sensors and other network resources. Robots connected to a
network are robots that interact with the Internet or a LAN through a
communication network. There are multiple ways to create networks,
including wireless, wired, or using protocols such as TCP, UDP, 802.11,
and more. Numerous new possibilities are being explored with these
robots, including automation and exploration. The Association of
Automation and Robotics in Network Robots defines two sub-categories
of network robots (network-connected): Tele-operated robots are robots
to which the human user sends commands and receives feedback
through the network. Such systems are used in research, education, and
public awareness using valuable resources available to a wide audience.
With autonomous robots, robots and sensors exchange information
over a network with minimal human intervention. The sensor network
expands the effective measurement range of robots and allows them to
communicate with one another over long distances to coordinate their
activities. Likewise, the robot can assist in the deployment, mainte-
nance, and maintenance of the sensor network to extend its life and
usefulness In both groups of network robots, a common challenge is
developing a scientific base that can be used to link control and create
new capabilities. The typical robot is a high-capacity closed system in
which upgrades or changes in performance and operation (remote or
local) require extensive knowledge and are usually subject to long
maintenance periods, and possesses no free communication interfaces,
and this is usually done to ensure security and control the effectiveness
of the robot. The concept of the IoT in intelligent robots goes beyond
network and mass robotics, which integrate heterogeneous intelligent
robots into a distributed architecture of cloud-and-edge operating sys-
tems. "IoT in intelligent robots" offers intelligent and advanced robots
with high and new capabilities by integrating IoT and intelligent robots
in today’s technology. The development of multi-radio access technol-
ogy to connect smart devices to the edge has created heterogeneous
cellular networks that require complex configuration, management, and
maintenance to support intelligent robots. The use of artificial intelli-
gence techniques enables IoT-enabled robotic systems to integrate
seamlessly with IoT capabilities to create optimal solutions for specific
applications. IoT technologies in robots enable the embedding of in-
formation in systems and processes, enabling companies to increase
efficiency, identify new business opportunities, and as a result, IoT-
based robotic systems are better prepared to meet multiple needs
within more complex environments (Campos et al., 2016), as exhibited
in Fig. 3 and Table 4.
2.3. Smart city IoT devices
Smart cities are driven by the IoT; it is the technology that enables
ubiquitous digitization, thus providing the basis for smart cities. Objects
are being connected to the internet more and more, enabling them to
transmit data and receive commands. This is known as the IoT. With the
IoT, you can collect data and use data analytics to provide useful in-
formation for policy and decision-making. The Internet is expected to
connect 75 billion devices by 2025 (Songhorabadi et al., 2023), allowing
even more applications to be created. Using the IoT, sensors in smart
cities could collect and send data about the condition of a city, which
could then be analyzed and used for decision-making. In terms of big
data and intelligent traffic signal systems, the classification of data po-
sitions is of critical importance. The data in the corners correspond to
the districts on Google Maps (Das, 2022). The data also includes a time
column that indicates congestion length. As a result, it will be possible to
determine the length and location of daily congestion, as well as when
and where it occurs. It is impossible to overestimate the importance of
IoT big data management surveys and analytics. Fig. 2 depicts an
all-encompassing perspective. Among the sections of the IoT are Big
Data Management, Analytical, Security, Privacy, and Energy Efficiency
(Uzair et al., 2019). In addition to categorizing and storing data in a
database, the big data framework must also place special emphasis on
unstructured data. Scaling big data is another crucial function for

reducing data storage size (see Table 3). Deep learning and analytics are
two methods of examining massive amounts of IoT data. IoT creates big
data that is unparalleled in its size, variety, and significance. Structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data exist. (Egri and V´ancza, 2013).
2.4. IoT application in smart city infrastructure
The IoT can be used in urban infrastructure such as bridges, subway
lines, railways, streets, etc. The IoT can also be used in the service areas
of cities and by coordinating different urban systems to do this more
effectively and efficiently for people.
3. Communication technologies
The IoT in intelligent robots requires new communication architec-
tures and equipment to operate effectively in the real environment,
which can perform complex computing and information exchange in
both the internal communication and edge computing in the real envi-
ronment and can virtualize Give the best way to do it. In this regard,
communication technology plays an important role in the IoT in robots.
Various IoT communication protocols are used in intelligent robots
to facilitate the layer-by-layer exchange of information. Table 5 shows
the different types of communication technology in "IoT in intelligent
robots".
3.1. Advanced IoT solutions for smart grids and smart city
Smart grids that incorporate IoT provide a fresh perspective on
power management, which is advantageous to all stakeholders. Smart
grids can be classified in various ways based on various components
(aspects). Using the smart grid’s first three elements (production,
transmission, and distribution) has presented several challenges to
pioneering research in this area, especially regarding production,
transmission, and distribution. The harsh environment in which the
sensors are located is largely to blame for the difficulties. Experimental
results obtained from the use of standard sensor networks compatible
with IEEE 802.15.4 show that wireless communication (includes both
LOS and NLOS scenarios) in intelligent networks due to electromagnetic
interference, equipment noise, Blockage, etc., closed error rate, and
variable link capacity is high. Additional limitations are imposed by
wireless nodes, such as memory limitations, processing limitations, and
inadequate power sources (see Table 6). With the IoT, people can design
intelligent solutions and bridge this chasm. The IoT is aimed at creating
a better and safer society where "everything is a service" (public safety,
health care, manufacturing, etc.). This section reports on relevant at-
tempts in the scientific literature. They are mainly devoted to wireless
sensor networks, home automation, and smart grids; they come under
the topic of IoT solutions for the smart city.
As a result of sophisticated software technologies, new designs have
been presented that emphasize the indoor environment and habitat
monitoring (See Fig. 4).

network interior and outside studies (air and water temperatures, solar
radiation sensors, weather conditions, and energy consumption data),
these thermal models are enhanced, thus providing more accurate pro-
jections of inside temperatures. Typical capacitance-resistance models
forecast an inaccuracy of 1.790 ◦C. A 2.4 GHz frequency is used for IEEE
802.15.4 internal communications. Gray estimation is used to determine
the model’s parameters. An energy management system connects smart
devices and software that calculates energy usage. As a result, welfare
services and consumers stand to gain from this approach. The use of
demand management systems is another prevalent statistic. In future
energy systems, these technologies will balance electricity consump-
tion/production at the customer level. In IoT solutions designed for
smart homes, the old DSM approach is giving way to cloud-based stra-
tegies. It is predicted that the cloud-based strategy will perform better
than a conventional technique in energy management because it offers

3.3. Smart city challenges
To digitize a city, it needs to have a proliferation of sensors in every
aspect of its operation. Smart cities present enormous challenges in
building and implementing IoT systems because of such a vast appli-
cation field. This section focuses on the challenges that IoT system de-
signers face while deploying smart city applications. Academics have
been interested in IoT adoption in smart cities because of the technical
challenges involved. Fig. 5 highlights the several obstacles that Smart
City IoT system implementations must overcome, such as Security and
Privacy, Smart Sensors, Networking, and Big Data Analytics (Ejaz et al.,
2017) (see Table 7).
3.4. About smart city privacy
Smart cities are the most secure and private when it comes to security
and privacy. It would be inconvenient and hazardous for its residents if
the city’s services were disrupted. Smart cities will only work if
important municipal facilities are online, so security will not be an issue.
Smart cities are more vulnerable to cybercrime and cyberwarfare in an
era when they are a strategy in global politics. This calls for the
encryption of network data transfers. Citizens’ confidence and partici-
pation are essential to the success of smart city programs. With sensors
continuously collecting information about people’s activities, the
expansion of sensors in smart cities may expose residents’ daily activities
to undesirable parties. Additionally, organizations and companies using
the IoT network may collect and exploit citizen data without their
awareness for eavesdropping or targeted advertising purposes. To allow
for proper decision-making, solutions will need techniques that ano-
nymize data collection while keeping the context of the measured job.
3.5. About smart sensors
For smart cities to conclude, sensor equipment must communicate
data, schedule activities, and aggregate data. By developing and
accepting open protocols, manufacturers can create interoperable
equipment, which will accelerate the deployment of IoT systems. It is
also possible to create ’standard’ access point nodes for IoT systems that
can communicate with devices utilizing a wide range of communication
protocols and analyze incoming data. As indicated in (Sato et al., 2019),
several equipment manufacturers have enabled compatibility with

alternative protocols. Reliability and durability are also concerns with
intelligent sensors. The IoT system’s reliability and robustness are
determined by its dependability and precision. The IoT is at the heart of
smart cities, and since it’s so crucial, the system must provide a seamless
experience for its citizens. Users’ requests for service must be handled
promptly
and
accurately.

4. A smart compact energy meter (SCEM) based on IoT
SCEMs based on IoT is designed to increase the performance, reli-
ability, and features of existing systems by implementing an active
customer strategy. The best SCEMs collect all data related to energy.
Power quality is addressed, as well as the possibilities for improving
DSM Remote control, easy updates, compact size, and low-cost devices
are disadvantages of the conventional system. As shown in Table 1, the
IoT system described in the paper compares with the hardware setup
discussed in the literature.
4.1. Objective
An innovative method categorizes the available load in the locality as
primary or secondary to view the power consumption pattern in the area
and automate the control of the load. It is considered a major load to
have lights, a fan, and a USB charger, whereas a secondary load is to
have an air conditioner. A Blynk application signal is sent to the
controller to control the main and secondary loads.
4.2. Architecture of commercial building energy management system
(CBEMS)
The CBEMS includes a PZEM-004T sensor and an ESP8266 wireless
module for providing real-time information regarding power con-
sumption, reactive power consumption, power factor, voltage, current,
and RMS values. In the load and wireless modules are ESP32 Micro-
controller Units and ESP8266. The ESP32 microcontroller family fea-
tures built-in Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth and is low-cost and low-
power. This antenna switch module includes an antenna switch, an RF
balun, a low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and a power-management
module. Microchip with a TCP/IP stack and microcontroller, ESP8266
is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip. This device allows microcontrollers to
connect to wireless networks and establish TCP/IP communications
without requiring additional hardware. Data is transmitted via Wi-Fi
from the Wi-Fi modules to a Raspberry Pi 4B + connected with a hot-
spot, which then forwards it via cloud Message Queuing Telemetry
Transport (MQTT) to the Blynk application of an authorized customer.
Before sending a report to Blynk, the Raspberry Pi Controller calculates
energy usage information and tariffs. Fig. 6 illustrates the CBEMS
architecture.
Blynk resends information from customers to microchip modules
through Blynk. When the virtual button on the User Interface of the
Blynk program is set to 1/0, the relay turns the load on/off. The
controller will turn off the secondary load even if the client switches it
on to keep the Time of Use tariff within the nominal range. Fig. 7 shows
the SCEM graphically.
4.3. Smart devices/smart tools
Connected to production and transmission lines, intelligent objects
may include appliances, lights, or sensors. These objects can sense data,
activate data, process data, and communicate between data. Objects that
sense and activate data must perform A/D and D/A conversions. These
devices perform measurements periodically and send sensed data (either
wirelessly or wirelessly) to the hub. In addition, if protocols allow,
sensed data can be sent directly to the cloud. Smart devices should send
the sensed data after processing the primary data. Remote data

activation is also possible. According to DSM, household appliances can
be divided into three categories: fixed appliances, flexible appliances,
and tools that are naturally dual-use. It’s not possible to manage rigid
devices, such as lights, televisions, computers, or hair dryers, which
relate to initial loads or other non-preventative activities. A flexible
appliance is designed to handle regular loads or preventive maintenance
(such as heating or cooling) and may be operated automatically. Dual-
purpose instruments are certainly versatile (such as a washing ma-
chine, dishwasher, or dryer), but they can also be flexible at times.
Clients may not be concerned with the exact time the washing machine
operates unless the time is set within a certain time limit. These devices
usually provide loads. The smart power grid allows smart devices (both
flexible and dual-function) to measure and control their energy con-
sumption in real-time(see Table 9).
5. Architectural design of the system
An intelligent building provides its users with individualized services
based on the information it contains about its contents, whether it is an
office, a residence, an industrial facility, or a recreation area. Buildings
not only need to be efficient but also habitable and productive since they
affect people’s quality of life and work. As a result of the installation of
building sensors and actuators, the associated cost must be balanced by
the economic advantage of energy savings. It is neither possible nor
practical to control the entire building. The final energy management
framework should include actual sensor data on such inputs, in addition
to patterns derived from data monitoring. It can therefore adapt to
changing architectural situations as well as to new situations that
weren’t considered in the original model. This platform is comprised of
three layers, which makes it suitable for a variety of smart environ-
ments, including those related to smart buildings. An IoT-based smart
building is depicted in Fig. 8 as a three-layer framework.
Data Sensing or Perception Layer - During the first layer, data is
collected from sensors. Users can request information about appliances
operating states, such as temperature and humidity, through this data
source. A network gateway saves the information in a BD cloud.
Data Processing or Network Layer – The data is organized and
processed in this layer. For comfort-related concerns, such as HVAC,
lighting, and temperature controls, individual user data is necessary.
Data Reproduction or Application Layer - The third layer repli-
cates data as a record of individual interactions between occupants and
equipment. Finally, the collected data is used to improve the efficiency
and functionality of the device. This leads to improved services for
citizens.
In the last decade, Cloud Computing, Information Systems, and
Emerging Technologies have generated amounts of data, and the mini-
aturization and output of IoT devices have increased. This information,
however, is useless without the ability to analyze it. To extract infor-
mation and make decisions, "Big Data Analysis" requires multiple levels
of concentration. Humans have been able to collect relevant data using
several analytical methods that integrate BD and IoT. In some ways, BD
could be seen as the older sibling of IoT. As a result of all this smart
technology, millions upon millions of data points are generated (IoT
sensors), ushering in the age of intelligent buildings. Building upkeep
and efficiency can be improved by using sensors that monitor temper-
ature, motion, light, and humidity. Using the analyzed data from the
cloud service, the motion sensor can also determine whether a resident
was offering a "safe" meaning. A voltage stabilizer will also allow the
mounted cloud server to operate automatically. The building’s Wi-Fi
connection allows users to connect via their phones to the network. By
installing cameras to monitor the environment remotely from a phone or
other device, intelligent technologies can be used to construct a safer
building. Furthermore, the security cameras are linked to other intelli-
gent equipment for efficient monitoring of the building based on

occupancy. Through their smart devices, residents can interact with the
security system. It may be connected to the lighting system, buzzers,
alarms, police station, etc. A security system responds when an intruder
or unusual movement is detected. There is no doubt that this intelligent
defense is much more dependable and effective than an emergency
siren. Additionally, homeowners will receive a maintenance plan to
ensure that all equipment is functioning and operating efficiently (see
Fig. 8).
To monitor the well-being of elderly people living alone at home,
intelligent building systems have been developed. In an intelligent
building, an occupant’s general physical activity, physiological pro-
cesses, and environmental elements can all be monitored simulta-
neously. Inconspicuous, inconspicuous, and non-invasive, this device is
strategically positioned throughout the structure. Providing continuous
monitoring in smart buildings may be possible with just one local
gateway server. Windows is used to run the software for analysis and
decision-making algorithms. Access to wellness-related information is
possible thanks to the Internet.
6. Discussion
The findings of this study illustrate the potential of IoT-based
frameworks to transform energy management in smart cities and
buildings. Through an analysis of existing literature, it is evident that IoT
technologies can improve energy efficiency, reduce environmental im-
pacts, and optimize operational performance. Smart cities, equipped
with IoT, ML, and AI, are capable of dynamically monitoring, predicting,
and managing energy consumption patterns. This capability allows cit-
ies to meet increasing energy demands while minimizing waste and
environmental harm. IoT-based energy management systems offer key
advantages, such as the ability to process real-time data from sensors,
smart meters, and appliances autonomously. With the integration of ML
algorithms, these systems can predict energy requirements, optimize
resource distribution, and adapt to changing consumption patterns
without human intervention. This results in enhanced energy efficiency,
reduced carbon emissions, and lower operational costs. Furthermore,
the inclusion of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, into
IoT-enabled grids supports sustainable urban energy systems. Despite
these advancements, the implementation of IoT frameworks still faces
technical, social, and economic barriers. Technically, interoperability
among devices, data security, and network reliability are persistent
challenges. Socially, concerns regarding user privacy, data ownership,
and equitable access to IoT systems remain unaddressed. Economically,
the high cost of deploying and maintaining IoT infrastructures, partic-
ularly in resource-constrained regions, limits widespread adoption. The
literature also reveals gaps in assessing the scalability and long-term
impacts of IoT-based systems. Existing studies often lack standardized

evaluation metrics, making it difficult to compare the performance of
different frameworks. Additionally, there is a need to explore how policy
interventions and public awareness can support the adoption of these
technologies. Addressing these gaps is essential for advancing IoT-based
energy management. Future research should focus on developing uni-
versally accepted protocols for device interoperability, robust data se-
curity frameworks, and cost-efficient solutions to make IoT technologies
accessible across diverse regions. Policies to reduce the digital divide
and promote inclusive adoption should also be prioritized. By tackling
these challenges, IoT frameworks can fully realize their potential to
create efficient, sustainable, and resilient energy systems in smart cities.
7. Conclusion
The Internet of Things has exhibited remarkable growth, expanding
its applications beyond early focus areas such as smart homes to sectors
including agriculture, industry, government, and business. Among
these, smart construction emerges as a critical domain where IoT can
enhance energy and operational efficiency. This study provides a review
of IoT frameworks for energy management, highlighting their potential
to reduce energy consumption and environmental impacts in smart
buildings. IoT-equipped smart buildings demonstrate enhanced opera-
tional efficiency, safety, and the capacity to address critical needs such
as comfort, accessibility, security, and energy efficiency. This paper
presents an IoT-based framework for energy management in smart cities
as a key contribution, that primarily focuses on a descriptive analysis wit
evaluation of the framework’s performance. It integrates various com-
ponents of the Internet of Things architecture in order to support
intelligent energy management applications, emphasizing the collec-
tion, storage, and intelligent analysis of data. Moreover, it facilitates the
development of third-party applications, thereby extending its utility
and adaptability.
The key findings of our analysis underscore the growing significance
of IoT-based frameworks in addressing contemporary energy manage-
ment challenges. While intuitive, these findings highlight critical aspects
for the effective integration of IoT into energy systems.
• IoT-based frameworks demonstrate potential in improving energy
efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, offering intelligent
solutions to optimize resource usage in smart cities and buildings.
• The escalating demand for energy underscores the need for innova-
tive strategies that not only enhance building maintenance efficiency
but also adapt to the increasing complexity of energy systems.
• There is a pressing need to delve deeper into IoT-based wireless
sensing systems, particularly their application in smart buildings.
Emphasizing intelligent analysis and fostering third-party applica-
tion development within the IoT ecosystem can address evolving
energy demands and operational challenge.
For future research, we recommend.
• A study of AI-based energy management systems in smart cities is
being conducted.
• Using IoT to manage secure, blockchain-based devices in smart
cities.
• IoT applications in smart grids and environments as an energy
Internet.
• Analyzing
the
management
of
IoT
applications
in
smart
environments.
• Identifying factors that facilitate the development of smart city in-
formation systems through the use of IoT and cloud computing.
• Implementing IoT-based smart applications in smart cities.
It is hoped that these directions will serve as a blueprint for re-
searchers, planners, architects, and stakeholders who wish to integrate
smart sensing technologies into future building designs in order to
achieve greater environmental and energy efficiency.
Limitation.
While this study presents a review of IoT-based frameworks for en-
ergy management in smart buildings and cities, several limitations
should be acknowledged. One key limitation is the reliance on existing
literature and secondary data sources, which may not capture the latest
advancements in IoT technologies or the evolving energy management
needs in real-world applications. As IoT systems and machine learning
algorithms develop rapidly, the frameworks reviewed in this study
might become outdated, potentially limiting the study’s applicability to
future developments. Another limitation arises from the diverse range of
IoT architectures and energy management systems reviewed. Although
this breadth provides a wide perspective, it also poses challenges in
comparing different frameworks that use varying technologies, pro-
tocols, and objectives. This diversity makes it difficult to establish a
unified model or set of best practices applicable across all smart cities
and buildings. The variation in technical specifications, geographical
locations, and energy consumption patterns further complicates a
standardized approach to intelligent energy management. Additionally,
the study focuses primarily on technical aspects, such as data collection,
storage, and intelligent analysis, while underemphasizing the social and
policy dimensions that are critical for the large-scale adoption of IoT-
based energy management systems. Factors such as regulatory pol-
icies, public awareness, user acceptance, and ethical considerations
related to data privacy and security are important but not thoroughly
explored. Furthermore, the study does not extensively address the eco-
nomic feasibility of implementing IoT systems on a large scale. The cost
of deploying smart sensors, managing data networks, and maintaining
infrastructure could be prohibitive for many cities, particularly those in
developing regions. Future research should include cost-benefit analyses
and investigate financial models that can support the widespread
adoption of IoT-based solutions in energy management. Lastly, the study
primarily focuses on urban areas, potentially limiting its relevance for
rural or less technologically advanced regions where IoT infrastructure
and energy management systems are less developed.
