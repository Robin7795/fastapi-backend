The benefits of monitoring aggregated electric load consumption and distinguishing it into its components are 
numerous and are mainly related to more efficient household energy management. Non-intrusive load moni­
toring (NILM) as a key method to accomplish this task has attracted the interest of the research community. The 
basis of this method is the acquisition process of the aggregated electrical signal, which can be performed at 
different sampling frequencies depending on the specifications of the disaggregation model. Nevertheless, the use 
of higher sampling frequencies can improve the performance of the disaggregation process. The development of 
different disaggregation models should be based on their applicability under practical conditions. This means 
that during their development, these models should include all parameters that will be met in real application. In 
this way, they will have a higher chance of effectively applying the load disaggregation in practice. Although 
there are several published review papers about NILM, there is a lack of a systematic review focusing on both the 
high-frequency domain and the practical aspects that need to be considered during model development. To this 
end, this study systematically reviews 40 recent papers in the high-frequency domain published between 2019 
and 2022. Then, the practical issues derived from them are discussed and referred to the different steps of NILM 
development. Finally, 30 of them are evaluated in terms of their disaggregation performance and whether their 
development is focused on practical applications, according to several criteria.

1. Introduction
NILM is not a new concept. It was first introduced by Hart in 1992 to 
determine the electrical energy consumption of individual appliances 
based on the aggregated electrical power measurements at the main 
feeding panel of an electrical installation [1]. Since then, several re­
searches have been performed in this area and many benefits have been

identified, suggesting that NILM could offer much to the electrical en­
ergy sector.
The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the reduction of 
electricity consumption are more than ever a necessity due to the 
greenhouse effect and the recent energy price crisis. Recent studies have 
shown that if consumers of electrical energy are aware of their elec­
tricity consumption, they can significantly reduce it. When real-time 
feedback is provided and at appliance level, consumers can reduce 
their electricity consumption by more than 12 % [2]. Therefore, NILM 
could be a game changer in attempts to improve electrical energy effi­
ciency and minimize greenhouse gas emissions.
Another aspect of using NILM in a more sustainable energy future is 
its applications in demand response (DR) activities. The decomposition 
of electrical energy into its component parts offers electric utilities and 
grid operators the opportunity to understand the consumption patterns 
at individual device level. In this way, DR strategies could be developed 
based on specific habits of electricity consumers, making specific sug­
gestions for the use of appliances, or control certain appliances without 
disturbing the comfort of consumers [3].
Up to this point, the potential contribution of NILM to a more sus­
tainable energy system was clearly related to consumer electricity con­
sumption flow. Nowadays, however, renewable energy sources, such as 
photovoltaic (PV) systems, are increasingly being integrated into 
household electrical installations shifting the traditional consumer to act 
as prosumer [4]. This current state of affairs has revealed an important 
new potential contribution of NILM in the context of prosumers’ elec­
tricity generation flow, bringing benefits to both prosumers and con­
sumers. The literature has shown that NILM can be used to determine 
the electricity production of residential photovoltaic systems [5–7]. In 
this way, DR strategies could be further developed based on consum­
ers’/prosumers’ electricity consumption and prosumers’ generation 
patterns and mitigate the potential negative impacts that could be hid­
den behind decentralized energy sources in a more sustainable way [5]. 
Power inverters coupled with PV systems or battery energy storage 
systems inject traceable harmonic distortion to the point of common 
coupling, thus NILM could also contribute in supervising the operation 
of these systems in order to ensure that the harmonic distortion does not 
exceed the permissible threshold set by the regulations. Also, in satu­
rated distribution networks (DN) new regulations define that additional 
PV systems should cap their power injection in the DN to avoid 
congestion and power quality issues; with NILM it is possible to verify 
the compliance of the PV power output to the permissible set points 
defined by the system operator.
One of the main characteristics of the NILM framework is whether 
the disaggregation scheme is based on event detection. In the case that 
an event detection algorithm is integrated in the NILM process, the 
disaggregation is taking place only after an event occurrence [8]. An 
event could be considered as an appliance transition from one steady 
state to another [9].
Another important point for grouping NILM techniques is whether 
they use true labels during development. If this is the case, the technique 
is supervised; if not, it is unsupervised. Supervised NILM techniques use 
true labeled datasets to be trained in the training phase, in order to link 
the data with the available true labels and achieve accurate predictions 
when unknown data are fed into the already trained NILM model. On the 
other hand, unsupervised NILM implementations are developed without 
the inclusion of true labels. In this case, data are grouped during model 
development and execution, without any guidance [10]. In recent years, 
due to practical needs for NILM applications, another category has 
emerged for grouping NILM techniques. This is the semi-supervised 
category, which can be considered a compromise between the super­
vised and unsupervised techniques. In the latter distinction, a small set 
of true labeled data is used along with a much larger unlabeled dataset 
[10,11].
Feature extraction is an essential component of any NILM system. It 
is a central part of the NILM implementation, whether the model is 
considered event-driven or not, and whether it is supervised, semi- 
supervised, unsupervised, or any other type of categorization. As part 
of the feature extraction process, the NILM device located at the main 
distribution board takes measurements of instantaneous values of cur­
rent and/or voltage at a specified sampling rate [12]. From these mea­
surements, it is possible to calculate different types of features that can 
be employed by the disaggregation model. The type of calculated fea­
tures is strongly dependent on the utilized sampling rate [13]. The 
literature review suggests that high sampling signals for feature 
extraction are those sampled at a frequency equal to, or higher than the 
fundamental frequency [14–16]. For example, the authors of [17] used 
instantaneous current measurements sampled at 10 kHz to apply 
short-time Fourier transform and extract current spectrograms. In 
Ref. [18], the amplitude and phase of the odd harmonic currents up to 
5th order were used as a result of applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
to the instantaneous current using zero-crossing detection of instanta­
neous voltage. Both instantaneous current and voltage measurements 
were sampled at 50 kHz.
The higher the sampling rate, the more information is included in the 
extracted signals, since more instantaneous values of current and 
voltage are extracted. Therefore, there is a higher probability of 
capturing the characteristics of appliances’ signatures, especially during 
transients or nonlinear behavior [19]. In addition, the advent of smart 
devices in modern homes, which are mainly power electronic loads, has 
led to the injection of harmonics into power lines. Hence, calculated 
features after harmonic analysis of an extracted signal could play an 
important role in a more robust description of the electrical signatures of 
such devices [20]. Consequently, a high sampling rate for the extraction 
of current and voltage signals could increase the robustness of the 
calculated features, leading to higher overall performance for the NILM 
task [21].
In recent years, the development of NILM has made great progress, 
especially involving high sampling rate signals. However, there is still a 
lack of practical applicability under real-world conditions. These con­
ditions are described by the need for a relatively cheap, plug-in, and 
easy-to-use NILM device with high sampling capabilities that would be 
responsible for extracting high sampling rate signals and computing 
features [15]. In this way, the acceptance by users would be significantly 
increased, leading to full exploitation of all the benefits that NILM can 
provide for better electrical energy management. Under real-operating 
conditions, it is almost unrealistic to develop disaggregation models 
able to handle any possible appliance brand. Thus, there is a need to 
develop NILM architectures characterized by universal models that can 
be used in any electrical installation [22]. To this end, further analysis of 
the key aspects of high sampling rate NILM frameworks and of how 
practical challenges can be incorporated into the development of a more 
accurate NILM system, should be conducted.
Recent reviews of NILM have already been presented in Refs. [2,15,
23]. In Ref. [15], the authors compared different NILM research works 
in terms of the features, algorithms, and datasets used, as well as the 
target applications of the developed frameworks. However, the litera­
ture compared use both low and high frequency, and its applicability in 
practice is compared and evaluated only within the narrow constraints 
of whether it incorporates publicly available benchmark datasets. 
Similarly, in Ref. [2], the authors review several recent NILM methods 
and features using any type of input signal sampling rate. As for the 
evaluation of the practicality of the compared works, it was limited to 
the general discussion of the difficulties of using NILM with supervised 
models due to the high labeling cost. Finally, in Ref. [23], the authors 
presented a multi-criteria comparison of different NILM implementa­
tions in terms of the datasets, models, and features used, as well as the 
associated extracted performance evaluation metrics without their 
values. Again, this work compared models belonging to both the low and 
high frequency domains. Furthermore, the comparison and evaluation 
of the literature in terms of practical challenges is limited to the 
computational costs related to the different NILM architectures.

Consequently, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, an analytical re­
view of recent developments in high sampling rate NILM and a detailed 
analysis of the practical challenges that should be considered at each 
stage of NILM development have not yet been thoroughly examined.
To address the identified research gap, this review work systemati­
cally examines the recently developed NILM frameworks that use high 
sampling rate input signals, discusses the parameters that should be 
considered with respect to practical NILM application, and critically 
evaluates most of the frameworks with respect to their performance and 
their applicability. In this sense, this work has the following 
contributions: 
• Presentation, analysis, and comparison of all publicly available high- 
frequency NILM datasets and their critical evaluation in terms of how 
valuable they are in enabling the research community to benchmark 
their work towards the practical application of NILM.
• Present and analyze different data processing approaches in terms of 
training, validation, and testing, and how best to use them to develop 
NILM in practice.
• Summarize different types of features extracted from high-frequency 
input signals and present the features that could make the difference 
in the performance of NILM application, considering real practical 
challenges.
• Presentation, analysis, and comparison of different NILM architec­
tures for the developed NILM frameworks and critical evaluation of 
these architectures in terms of their contributions and limitations in 
case of a practical NILM application.
• Detailed analysis and comparison of different current high sampling 
rate NILM implementations with an assessment of their performance 
and provision of their key metrics, while in parallel they are critically 
evaluated regarding all the above parameters that need to be 
considered in terms of their practicality. Providing the key metrics 
also gives the NILM research community the opportunity for 
benchmarking comparison, keeping in mind the practical challenges.
• Presentation of various other practical challenges that may arise in 
NILM development and the proposed solutions with concrete 
examples.
2. Data
2.1. High sampling NILM datasets
Datasets are an essential part of NILM development. They contain 
various electrical power measurements including aggregate and indi­
vidual measurement points, along with the required true labels [24]. 
Over the past decade, a significant amount of publicly available NILM 
datasets have emerged, which is an important prerequisite for the 
development of NILM methodologies, i.e. the existence of a benchmark 
evaluation step. This step involves applying known evaluation metrics to 
various proposed NILM algorithms using measurements from these 
datasets [25].
In this review, a comprehensive analysis of the most recent publicly 
available versions of high sampling NILM datasets has shown that they 
can be divided into 3 categories. The categorization is firstly derived 
from whether the high sampling rate signals concern single or combined 
operation of appliances. Secondly, from whether the true labels of the 
signals for the combined operation of appliances are derived from time- 
stamped low-frequency measurements or are derived directly from time- 
stamped events of appliances. 
1) Single operation of appliances (SOA): The basic goal of the disag­
gregation scheme is to decompose the extracted signal into its 
components. However, in this category there are only high sampling 
rate signals related to the single operation of appliances, which is far 
from the usual practical conditions and far from the goal of NILM 
[26]. Here, there are 4 high sampling NILM datasets. 
• WHITED [27].
• COOLL [28].
• HFED [29].
• MORED [30].
2) Combined operation of appliances with low frequency true labels 
(COA-LFTL): These datasets provide publicly available electricity 
consumption data on the combined operation of appliances. How­
ever, they do not contain sufficiently reliable true labels due to the 
low frequency of them [26]. For example, the true operation of ap­
pliances is implied from power consumption data given every few 
seconds. Here, there are 4 high sampling NILM datasets. 
• REDD [31].
• UK-DALE [32].
• NILM-UY [33].
• SustDataED2 [34].
3) Combined operation of appliances with event based true labels 
(COA-EBTL): This category of publicly available high-frequency 
NILM datasets fits perfectly with the requirements of real-world 
NILM development. Here, more than one appliance is operating 
simultaneously and true labels about appliance operation are derived 
directly and reliably from appliance events, facilitating accurate 
training and performance evaluation [26]. In this last category there 
are 6 high sampling NILM datasets. 
• PLAID3 [35].
• BLOND [36].
• HELD2 [26,37].
• LIT [38].
• BLUED [38,39].
• LILAC [40].
The main features of the above high sampling NILM datasets under 
the scope of this study are shown in Table 1. In summary, the most useful 
datasets for the development of real-world high sampling rate NILM are 
those that allow researchers to apply their disaggregation algorithms to 
multiple instances that involve the simultaneous operation of appli­
ances. The availability of highly reliable true labels through appliance 
events is of paramount importance for the development of accurate 
disaggregation methods. When this is not the case, biased errors occur 
during both training and evaluation, making benchmarking of the 
methods difficult.
2.2. Processing of NILM datasets
The use of datasets is a necessary step in the implementation of 
NILM. The way available data are processed during the development of 
the NILM framework strongly affects the generalizability that the 
disaggregation scheme gains over real-world data [41].
One of the main aspects of datasets’ processing relates to the 
approach used to divide the data into training, validation, and test 
datasets for supervised and unsupervised techniques, or some other 
compromise thereof [42]. Several approaches to data partitioning are 
known in the literature. The most common of these for high sample rate 
NILM implementations are presented in the following analysis, along 
with a critical evaluation of the limitations and contributions to the 
potential application of the developed load disaggregation models in 
unseen data from real implementations.
A common method for splitting is to randomly split the dataset into 
only 2 subsets. The first is called the training set, in which the NILM 
algorithm is trained, and the second is called the test set, where the 
algorithm is evaluated. The percentage split of the total available data 
determines the size of the 2 sets. A common percentage split is 80 %/20 
%, where 80 % of the total available data is considered the training set 
and the remaining 20 % is considered the test set [17,43]. Within this 
category of random data splitting, there are also some other percentage 
splitting values, for example, the 70 %/30 % [44] or the 50 %/50 % 
[45]. Despite the simplicity of this approach, it lacks good generalization 
P.G. Papageorgiou et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 213 (2025) 115497

ability. This is because this random partitioning of data results in some 
data classes being trained with many examples and others with fewer 
examples, which means poor performance on the available test data 
[46].
In the same context, but with a different approach for dividing the 
dataset into training and testing subsets, there is the time-based data 
splitting. In this case, a certain percentage of the first entries of the 
dataset is considered as the training set, while the rest of the data 
collected in time form the test set. Again, the percentage partitioning 
varies. For example, in Ref. [47], the authors study the identification of a 
coil gun. For their work, they created a private dataset by extracting 
instantaneous current measurements from a single operation of a coil 
gun with a sampling frequency of 10 kHz. The first 70 % of the 140 
monitored seconds of coil gun operation constituted the training set, 
while the remaining 30 % represented the test set. In the same way, the 
authors in Ref. [48] created a private dataset containing example sets of 
10 features involving the percent harmonic distortion of odd total har­
monic currents. All features were extracted from a commercial smart 
electricity meter with high sampling capabilities (62.5 kHz) and stored 
with a recording frequency of 1/60 Hz with respect to 4 different clus­
ters for a total data collection of 6 months. This dataset was divided into 
training and test sets, with the first 70 % of the data assigned to the 
training set and the remaining 30 % to the test set. Other percentage 
apportionment approaches are the 90 %/10 % [49] or the 6 days/1 day 
[19] for training and test sets respectively. As with the random-based 
division of the dataset into training and test sets, the time-based 
approach lacks generalizability for the same reasons. However, this 
approach tests the NILM framework one step closer to reality by 
providing a clear time division in training and then applying the trained 
electrical energy disaggregation scheme to unseen data in practice [50].
To bring the character of practical real-world conditions into the 
developed model, the authors in Ref. [51] developed a private dataset 
with training and testing parts. The training set consisted of 7 subsets of 
200 s of extracted instantaneous current measurements per appliance 
and aggregated instantaneous voltage measurements, including all 15 
different appliance combinations from 4 different appliances with 
different starting conditions per subset. During the training phase a 
7-fold cross validation approach was used. Finally, the test set included 6 
subsets of instantaneous measurements, just like the training set, but this 
time with significantly more load variation.
The inclusion of a validation set along with the different types of 
measurements in all parts of a utilized dataset improves the general­
ization capability and evaluates the NILM model under unseen practical 
operating conditions [52]. However, not only different patterns in 
appliance operation, but also measurements coming from different 
brands of the same appliance type could be considered as an even 
greater practical challenge in real case NILM implementations [53]. In 
this direction, the authors in Ref. [54] used samples from an older 
version of the dataset PLAID and divided it into training, validation, and 
test sets. For the formation of the training set, samples from the appli­
ances of 42 randomly selected houses were used, which are among the 
60 available houses in the dataset. For the formation of the validation 
set, samples from the appliances of 6 of the remaining houses were used, 
and for the formation of the test set, samples from the appliances of the 
last 12 houses were used. In this way, generalizability under practical 
conditions and evaluation in real unseen scenarios are taken into ac­
count by using a validation set and a test set containing appliances of the 
same type but different in terms of brand, even if different from the 
training set. In this way, once a model has been developed and gener­
alized to different data distributions, it is tested as an application-ready 
solution in different electrical installations [55].
As can be seen from the above analysis, the training, validation, and 
testing subsets are important for the development of real-world appli­
cable disaggregation models. The availability of true labels is of great 
importance in all subsets and incurs significant costs in terms of time and 
money [56]. When applying a NILM model in practice, cost should be 
considered in all aspects. Therefore, reducing the cost of labeling while 
maintaining disaggregation performance is a current research goal. The 
main method that meets these requirements is active learning. In this 
approach, true labels are assigned only to those examples that contain 
the most valuable information. Thus, the development of the disaggre­
gation algorithm is based only on high value features; the size of dataset 
used is reduced and that corresponds to a reduction in the labeling cost 
[57]. For example, in Ref. [56], the most valuable labeling samples were 
selected and the features were learned with an active deep learning 
model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, resulting 
in a significant reduction in the required samples while maintaining the 
same classification performance.

In summary, the nature of the data and the way they are processed 
during the development of the NILM model determines the scalability of 
the disaggregation scheme in real-world scenarios. In practice, it is more 
than likely that the NILM will have to be applied under different con­
ditions for appliances of different brands and operating patterns, 
compared to those for which it was developed. Thus, the greater the 
generalizability that a model acquires, the greater the possibility of 
successfully applying it to completely unknown measurements. This 
possibility should be tested and the results should be presented 
regarding the performance of a proposed NILM framework on real-world 
scenarios. In this case, the NILM research community has the opportu­
nity to evaluate the applicability of the proposed algorithms in terms of 
sufficient disaggregation performance on real implementations. In 
addition, NILM application should consider cost, even at this early stage 
of model development in terms of the data processing part. All of these 
desirable data processing aspects for a NILM that can be applied in 
practice are summarized in Fig. 1.
2.3. High sampling features
The datasets to be used for high-frequency NILM development, like 
those mentioned above, include high sampling rate feature extraction 
signals, or recorded features extracted from high sampling rate signals 
[48]. Either way, high sampling rate signals are an essential part of the 
necessary feature extraction in a high sampling rate disaggregation 
process. The contribution of using high sampling features has been 
highlighted in several works [33,58] and several high sampling features 
have been extracted in different implementations utilizing signals with 
high sampling rate of instantaneous current and/or voltage [59].
A common approach to create features is to directly use the high 
sampling rate signals of instantaneous current and voltage. The authors 
in Ref. [60] used instantaneous current and voltage measurements for 
extracting one electrical cycle at a time through the proposed method to 
form the recurrence plots for current and voltage cycles. These were 
then introduced in the proposed spatial pyramid pooling CNN archi­
tecture for appliance classification.
Another type of feature extraction is to process the high sampling 
rate current and voltage measurements and create features from the 
results of the processing. A common processing step prior to the feature 
creation phase is the application of frequency domain analysis. In this 
context, in Ref. [19], the instantaneous current and voltage measure­
ments were preprocessed and converted into 1-sec frames with 16,000 
samples per electrical feature to form the instantaneous power matrix 
per frame for the application of the double Fourier integral analysis and 
the extraction of the magnitude and phase matrices. These matrices 
were then used by the proposed CNN regression model per appliance to 
determine the power consumption of the appliances. The robustness of 
these features is based on the additional information of the sideband 
harmonics they contain. The sideband harmonics are ensembles of sums 
and differences of current and voltage waveforms that fully reproduce 
the spectral content of the appliance model, especially under the sign of 
even-order harmonics.
Another possible result of the frequency domain analysis is the 
amplitude and phase extraction of the current harmonics. In Ref. [61], 
the FFT for the instantaneous current was performed using the 
zero-crossing detection of the instantaneous voltage, both sampled at 50 
kHz. Then, the amplitudes and phases of the odd harmonic currents up 
to the 5th order (1st, 3rd, and 5th) were extracted for 10 different ap­
pliances, taking a total of about 4–5 min per appliance for data collec­
tion. Here, the combined extraction of amplitudes and phases facilitates 
the formulation of the vectors of current harmonics, resulting in 
improved disaggregation performance. Similarly, in Ref. [48], the 
extracted amplitudes of odd harmonic currents up to the 7th order were 
used to calculate the % harmonic distortion of the 3rd, 5th, and 7th 
current harmonics provided by a smart electricity meter along with 
other general electrical characteristics. Finally, in the same context of

processing the instantaneous values prior to feature generation, the 
authors in Ref. [62] contributed to appliance classification by presenting 
a set of novel features describing the transient current shape of the 
harmonics of certain orders extracted by applying the Stockwell trans­
form to the transient instantaneous current measurements. In Ref. [63], 
three proposed transient features were calculated from the application 
of the Hilbert transform to the extracted transient instantaneous current. 
These were the instantaneous amplitude, phase and frequency. The 
employment of them resulted in better appliance classification due to 
better description of time and shape of the transients.
The main objective of feature extraction based on instantaneous 
values of current and voltage with high sampling rate is to significantly 
improve the uniqueness of the created features. In this way, better 
disaggregation performance is anticipated for the NILM model. How­
ever, the robustness of the extracted features should be oriented to be 
preserved under real practical disaggregation conditions. For example, 
the high percentage of similarity that resistive appliances have in a real 
household makes appliance classification not an easy task without 
appropriate measures [40]. In this context, the authors in Ref. [64] 
proposed a reconstruction method for typical V-I images to make these 
features more unique and improve the identification performance 
among similar appliances, especially the resistive ones. Similarly, in 
Ref. [65], magnitude and phase of the lower odd harmonics were 
extracted by FFT processing of the instantaneous current signal to enable 
better classification performance for appliances with similar power 
consumption, which is common in the real household electrical 
installations.
3. High sampling NILM frameworks
3.1. Analysis
In general, after a common pre-processing phase, the analysis of 
which is beyond the scope of this study, the features extracted from high 
sampling rate signals are introduced into a NILM architecture that per­
forms the necessary tasks to classify the appliances and/or determine the 
power consumption of the appliances [23,66].
In the pre-processing phase, some potential practical issues related to 
the data can be addressed to mitigate the negative impact on the sub­
sequent feature extraction process. When using time series, missing 
values are not an unlikely scenario. Although there is no universal so­
lution for this case in the literature, the variants of interpolation are 
commonly used [23]. Simple interpolation techniques, such as linear 
interpolation, have the advantage that they are easy to implement. 
However, for highly fluctuating time series, they may not be sufficient to 
accurately fill in the missing values. The main reason for this is that 
these methods do not consider the entire data series [67]. An improved 
method proposed in Ref. [67], called noisy interpolation, uses a cubic 
interpolation in which white Gaussian noise is added to fill in the 
missing values in a correlated but also stochastic way in a limited range. 
Another data-related aspect that could be solved in the pre-processing 
phase is the existence of outliers. A widely used solution for the pres­
ence of outliers is filtering. Median filters or other filter combinations 
applied to the input data aim to smooth it out, resulting in improved 
disaggregation performance [68,69]. The presence of outliers can also 
have a negative impact in certain NILM-related processes such as 
dimension reduction through principal component analysis (PCA) [70]. 
In Ref. [70], the negative effects of outliers are mitigated by the pro­
posed robust PCA method, which leads to more reliable PCA features.
The number of different NILM architectures in the literature is huge 
and could be divided into several groups. However, given the high 
sampling rate nature studied in this review and the evaluation of the 
NILM frameworks under real-world applicability, the number of 
different disaggregation models is limited, and the main categorization 
perspective followed here depends on whether the disaggregation 
scheme follows a time-driven or an event-driven approach.
In a disaggregation model, a time-driven approach is assumed to be 
followed when the NILM algorithm is invoked to perform appliance 
classification continuously per each set of features extracted per each 
time window of the signal or signals. On the other hand, a disaggrega­
tion scheme is considered event-driven if it is invoked to apply the 
appliance classification for sets of features that come from time windows 
in which an appliance event occurs [9]. In particular, in the high fre­
quency domain, this categorization is closely related to whether or not 
the NILM frameworks can be used efficiently in a real practical scenario. 
This conclusion stems firstly from the nature of NILM in the 
high-frequency domain, where the data resolution of the processed 
signals is high, and secondly from the frequency at which the total load 
disaggregation processing is invoked. Clearly, both of these issues 
significantly affect the computational complexity required in a NILM 
algorithm, especially in a real-time application [9]. The event-driven 
approaches have higher practical applicability in actual operating con­
ditions since the total times in which the algorithm is invoked to apply 
high frequency load disaggregation are significantly lower.
1) Time-Driven High Sampling NILM Frameworks: The main point 
that characterizes all the different NILM frameworks in this category is 
that there is no event detection algorithm in the different implementa­
tions to detect state changes of the appliances and trigger load classifi­
cation. There are 2 types of high sampling NILM frameworks in this 
category. 
a) Time-Driven Appliance Event Type Classification High Sampling 
NILM Frameworks: In this type, the goal of the NILM framework is to 
use the extracted set of features continuously for each time window 
of the input signal to match it with an on or off event of a particular 
appliance, as implemented in Ref. [71].
b) Time-Driven Appliance Classification High Sampling NILM Frame­
works: This type is different from the above in terms of the final 
output result. Here, the NILM framework tries to assign each 
extracted set of features to the corresponding cluster related to the 
operation of a particular load, as in Ref. [51].
2) Event-Driven High Sampling NILM Frameworks: In this category, 
the key process, which is also a fundamental difference in terms of how a 
time-driven NILM framework works, is event detection. The task of the 
event detection algorithm is to detect any change in the operational 
status of the appliances and trigger load classification. In this category, 
there are 3 types of high sampling NILM frameworks. 
a) Event-Driven Event Matching and Appliance Classification High 
Sampling NILM Frameworks: The objective of this type is to extract 
sets of features related to the time windows of the input signal where 
events occur in order to match the on with the off events. This is 
followed by a classification process to associate the extracted fea­
tures of the time window of the time frame between the on and off 
events to the operation of a particular load, as [72] performed. This 
approach to a high-sampling NILM framework is more applicable 
than the time-driven approaches under real practical conditions due 
to its event-driven nature, but it still has room for improvement in 
post-event detection processing. The processes of event detection, 
event matching, and load classification could be shortened to obtain 
the total load disaggregation in the same type of output.
b) Event-Driven Appliance Classification High Sampling NILM Frame­
works: In this approach, there is no event matching within the load 
disaggregation task. More specifically, for the needs of event detec­
tion the model uses the input signal to detect if there is a change in 
the operating mode of the appliances. When an event is detected, the 
framework again uses the input signal to extract a set of features that 
describe the time window of the event. Then, usually, these features 
are introduced into the load classification algorithm to determine the 
appliances that participate in the total power consumption, as in 
Ref. [63]. This method, where there is no event matching step, leads 
P.G. Papageorgiou et al.

6 

to the same load disaggregation result but with less complicated 
processing after event detection. When an event is detected, load 
classification determines the appliances in operation, taking into 
account that they will remain in operation until a new event is 
detected. Then the load classification determines again which ap­
pliances are in operation. From this new result, it can be concluded 
which appliance has changed its state, bypassing event matching.
c) Event-Driven Appliance Event Type Classification High Sampling 
NILM Frameworks: The above type of event-driven high-sampling 
NILM framework appears to involve dual processing within the 
overall implementation of load disaggregation [17]. This can be 
easily deduced by focusing on the completely separate processes of 
event detection in the first stage, which uses the input signal, and 
load classification in the second stage, which in turn uses the input 
signal of the measurements. On the other hand, in the event-driven 
appliance event type classification high sampling NILM framework, 
which is analyzed as a potential application in this section, event 
detection and classification of the detected event as on or off event of 
a particular appliance are implemented sequentially as one process. 
Thus, the classifier does not need to use the input signal again to 
extract a set of features describing the detected event and classify it. 
In this way, the processing time is reduced, which facilitates the 
development of a NILM framework that can be used in practice for 
high sampling rate measurements. For a general analysis of the 
framework, it could be noted that the event detection algorithm in 
the first phase could use the input signal to compute a feature that is 
used to detect the occurrence of an appliance event. After an event is 
detected, the feature related to the time window of the event could 
usually be introduced into the event classification part and assigned 
to a on or off of a particular appliance.
The summary representation of the different categories in relation to 
the high sampling NILM frameworks is shown in Fig. 2.
3.2. Literature evaluation
The crux of this section is the comparative presentation of 30 
research studies. These studies were the result of a systematic search for 
NILM works published from 2019 to 2022, under the consideration that: 
(a) they should have used high sampling rate signals, (b) they can be 
evaluated in terms of disaggregation performance, and (c) they can be 
evaluated in terms of contribution to the development of NILM in the 
real world regarding the aspects that have been discussed. Specifically, 
the NILM papers published in the above-mentioned period were first 
evaluated according to whether or not they used high sampling rate 
signals as input for the corresponding disaggregation task. Obviously, 
only the papers that processed high sampling rate signals as input were 
selected for further evaluation. In the next step, the NILM works were 
evaluated as to whether or not they contained the required disaggre­
gation performance evaluation of their proposed method. Only if this 
was the case, they could in turn be compared with the rest of the liter­
ature. The NILM papers that met conditions (a) and (b) were assessed for 
final selection according to whether or not they could be evaluated in 
terms of practical NILM development. Specifically, for the final selection 
related to the practical development of NILM according to the aspects 
discussed, the works were evaluated according to whether or not they 
contain the necessary information about the single or combined opera­
tion of appliances, the dataset(s) used, the type of framework and the 
utilized features. For example, if a paper used a high sampling rate input 
signal and presented its evaluation of disaggregation performance, but 
did not mention the type of operation of the appliances for which the 
evaluation metric was extracted, it could not be part of the literature 
review presented here. The same exclusion would apply in the case that 
not all necessary specifications were included to facilitate categorization 
under the NILM frameworks mentioned above.
Table 2 is a more general comparison table of the performance of the 
NILM frameworks presented. In Table 3, the reader will find a com­
parison that elaborates on the applicability of the included works in the 
real world. In Table 2, for each reference, some main aspects of the 
respective NILM framework are presented, starting with the year of 
publication, the frequency of the input signal used, and the general in­
formation of the framework. Furthermore, the main performance metric 
is listed. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of the compared works 
have included more than one performance metrics in their imple­
mentations. However, for the presentation in Table 2, the evaluation 
metric chosen was the one that was closer to evaluating the application 
of each proposed NILM method in real-world scenarios. In addition, the 
performance metric chosen was the one that more rigorously assessed 
the developed framework. For example, if a work was evaluated using 
both the FScore and the accuracy metric for the single and combined 
operation of appliances, the FScore for the combined operation of ap­
pliances was chosen as the final metric. In this way, the work is evalu­
ated more rigorously by the comparatively more reliable FScore metric 
on the one hand, and under conditions closer to practical application, 
such as combined operation of appliances versus single operation of 
appliances, on the other. The type and number of instances used to 
extract each metric are presented subsequently. For example, in 
Ref. [45], the metric presented was extracted using 6 different appli­
ances, 2 of which had 2 discrete modes of operation. Therefore, the total 
number of distinct groups for which the proposed disaggregation algo­
rithm was applied was 8. In Ref. [73], the number of distinct appliances 
involved was 20, but the evaluation was the average result of a 10-fold

replicate. Therefore, the number in the Groups section is 10. Another 
example is [63] where the proposed disaggregation method concerned 5 
different appliances and 4 different combinations of them, so the total 
number of different groups is 9. In Refs. [20,74], there was 1 combi­
nation of 5 different appliances. However, in the first study, the appli­
ance classification was evaluated under a multi-class consideration, 
meaning that the identification aimed at the whole combination of ap­
pliances involved, so the number of groups was 1 [48]. On the other 
hand, in Ref. [74], despite the fact that the combination of appliances 
was 1, the identification of the 5 different appliances within the com­
bination was evaluated under a multi-label consideration, resulting in a 
total number of 5 different groups. In the multi-label assessment, the 
identification of each appliance within the combination was assessed 
separately from the others [48]. As a result, the performance metric was 
extracted between 5 different groups. A more general explanation of the 
multi-label nature in the presented evaluation metrics is that in the 
corresponding implementations, the identification performance was 
focused on specific appliances while other appliances were in operation. 
Another concept that needs to be clarified is the macro/micro-averaged 
calculation of the presented metrics. The macro-averaged calculation 
refers to the well-known and easy-to-calculate arithmetic averaging 
which adds the separately extracted metrics for all participating groups 
and then divides the sum by the total number of all different groups 
[64]. The micro-average, on the other hand, is calculated considering 
the number of examples evaluated per group [75]. Table 2 concludes 
with the information about the inclusion of a competent comparison of 
the presented implementations with other literature methods regarding 
the listed performance metrics. A comparison is considered competent 
only if it was applied to the same type of data in terms of the dataset 
used, the appliances studied, etc. If there was another important com­
parison, this is indicated with the appropriate comment.
Table 3 compares the main aspects of each study that could facilitate 
the evaluation of each proposed method in terms of whether or not it 
was developed with real-world scenarios in mind. The first criterion for 
this type of evaluation is the dataset used and the processing of the data 
in the development of each proposed NILM disaggregation algorithm 
based on the analysis presented in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 respectively. In 
detail, for each work, all the examined datasets are presented with a 
further explanation of the dataset used to extract the highlight metric. 
The fifth and sixth columns of Table 3 provide the type of each devel­
oped NILM framework, in the context of the analysis presented in Sec­
tion 3.1, as well as the features used, extracted from the high sampling 
rate signals and introduced in each proposed NILM architecture.
Finally, the last three columns of Table 3 contain the rest of the 
assessment of the applicability of the compared studies in real world 
applications. In particular, the seventh column indicates whether or not 
the proposed NILM schemes have evaluated the disaggregation algo­
rithms on the combined operation of appliances, which is more than 
expected in a real scenario. It is not uncommon to see research works in 
the field of NILM that evaluate their developed models on single 
appliance operation. In other words, they evaluate the identification 
performance of the algorithms while a single appliance is operating at a 
time. The eighth column of Table 3 indicates whether or not the 
compared studies explored disaggregation of appliances into multiple 
states for the extraction of highlight metrics. This type of disaggregation 
is a criterion for evaluating applicability in the real case, since in real life 
a non-negligible number of appliances operate in different modes. Thus, 
if a disaggregation model could recognize the different modes of oper­
ation, then it could be useful for application to a complicated disag­
gregation task that corresponds to reality and provides a more detailed 
understanding of the electrical energy consumption [76]. The last col­
umn of Table 3 lists the information about the appliances with the lowest 
active power consumption that participated in the disaggregation task. 
The identification of appliances with low power consumption is a proof 
of the robustness of the proposed NILM models, which can even classify 
appliances whose consumption is comparable to noise [77].
4. Other practical challenges
4.1. Noise effects
The presence of noise is inevitable in measurements related to NILM 
and is associated with performance degradation in terms of load disag­
gregation accuracy [84]. Therefore, various approaches have been used 
to try to reduce the noise effects in different parts of the NILM pipeline.
For example, in Ref. [72], the authors converted the classical cu­
mulative sum control chart algorithm into a DSWC control chart algo­
rithm for transient event detection. This was achieved by applying 
variable point identification in a composite dual sliding window 
method. In DSWC, small variables in composite sliding windows are 
more sensitive and the effects of data noise are reduced. As a result, the 
true load event can be extracted from the raw data and isolated from the 
power fluctuations.
Aiming to reduce the effects of noise in load disaggregation, the 
authors in Ref. [79] developed a novel method for event detection 
combining probabilistic and expert heuristic models. This method is 
overall more powerful than other implementations, especially when the 
events are characterized as small current events (when the difference in

high-frequency current amplitude of the current transition from one 
steady state to another is less than 1 A), with a lower signal-to-noise ratio 
and a larger fundamental current.
4.2. Execution time
A crucial parameter for NILM implementation in real-time applica­
tions concerns the execution time of the disaggregation scheme [85].
In this review work, we highlight some attempts aimed at reducing 
the time required for the load disaggregation process. In Ref. [49], a 
multi-threaded architecture for real-time load identification was pro­
posed that significantly reduces the time required to implement parallel 
NILM tasks. A comparison showed that the single-threaded cumulative 
summation-multilayer perceptron (CUSUM-MLP) NILM framework 
required 45 ms to identify a single example, while the multi-threaded 
CUSUM-MLP NILM framework required 7 ms to identify the same 
example.
In another example from the literature, the authors in Ref. [80] 
suggest that translating the instantaneous current waveform into 
grayscale images can reduce the time required to identify loads. More 
specifically, in their implementation, the process of capturing the event 
instantaneous current is applied with the use of the sliding window al­
gorithm. Each sliding window (containing periods of instantaneous 
current waveform) is converted into a 320x320 grayscale image. All 
320x320 extracted grayscale images are compared with the grayscale 
images (under the same resolution) extracted during the training phase 
and stored in the database. The comparison is achieved by the proposed 
CNN-based architecture, which uses the extracted 320x320 grayscale 
images and leads to the identification of the load. The extended results 
by determining the start-stop time and state change of the load facilitate 
the determination of the power consumption of the load.
4.3. Equipment
As NILM evolves in practical applications, the existence of devices 
that can perform measurements at a high sampling rate and function 
properly the NILM tasks at an affordable cost is a goal that some re­
searchers have already investigated. In Ref. [86], the authors propose a

device for measuring instantaneous current and voltage and provide a 
design analysis of the hardware architecture for the current and voltage 
conditioning stages along with the software implementation in an 
Arduino MKR Zero microcontroller that mainly uses an interrupt routine 
for real-time data acquisition and storage on a micro-SD card. The 
proposed system implementation enables a high sampling rate (6.25 
kHz), resulting in a duration of about 37 ms for storing 204 current and 
voltage values on the used SD card. Moreover, the whole data acquisi­
tion process could be applied for 25.4 days. The proposed system is 
low-cost and low-power, requires its own power supply, and is easy to 
install. Some other specifications of the proposed measurement system 
are the maximum active power monitoring of about 6 kW with granu­
larity of 11.3 W. Therefore, this device could be used for monitoring the 
electrical power of a main feeding panel for the needs of practical 
application of NILM.
In this sense, in Refs. [87,88], the authors have proposed a system on 
chip (SoC) architecture based on a field programmable gate array device 
targeted to real-time applications of NILM. More specifically, the ar­
chitecture is associated with an ADE9153A circuit that extracts the 
instantaneous current and voltage measurements with a sampling fre­
quency of 4 kHz. In addition, a low-level peripheral integrated into the 
SoC architecture is responsible for real-time filtering and event detection 
of the extracted signals. The event detection algorithm examines the 
amplitude value of the difference between 2 consecutive samples of the 
mean square current. An event is considered as such if the amplitude 
value is greater than a threshold and at the same time the maximum of 
the amplitude values of a given window of amplitude value samples. 
Finally, an ARM processor controls the entire system and could be used 
by a NILM load identification model. This type of architecture facilitates 
real-time, high-sampling-rate event-driven load disaggregation at the 
input point of an electrical system. Also, enables real-time, high-­
sampling-rate event data transmission to the cloud side of an end-cloud 
NILM framework for load disaggregation without bandwidth conges­
tion. In this way, the overall implementation cost remains low despite 
the high sampling rate of the device.
5. Conclusion and study outputs
Research on the development of NILM has been at the forefront for 
more than three decades. Its contribution to the energy sector has been 
highlighted in various research papers in different ways and improving 
its performance has been a goal of researchers. Technological develop­
ment in measurement systems has enabled higher sampling rates, which 
allowed the investigation of the contribution of higher sampling rate to 
improve the performance of the NILM application. The results suggest 
that a deeper analysis of the electrical signal in terms of acquiring a 
higher number of samples for a given time window could significantly 
improve the performance of load disaggregation and distinguish the 
fingerprints of the different types of electrical loads represented on the 
aggregated electrical signal. However, NILM is a framework developed 
with the perspective of applying it in practice to fully exploit its benefits. 
To this end, several parameters should be considered in the different 
steps of NILM development. This review study shows that: 
• The type of a public high sampling NILM dataset is of paramount 
importance for the NILM research community to benchmark its work 
against practical conditions of combined operation of appliances. 
Thus, such a dataset should contain instances of combined operation 
of appliances along with high reliability of true labels’ availability.
• Processing the available data in terms of training, validation, and 
testing of the developed NILM models should be done considering 
different operating patterns and different brands of appliances 
participating in the training, validation, and test sets to ensure 
improved generalization capability of the developed models. In this 
sense, better disaggregation performance could be achieved in 
practice if completely unseen data are fed into the NILM model used.
• The development of high-frequency features should aim to represent 
inherent characteristics that could distinguish appliances with 
similar electrical behavior in terms of their operation, which is a 
common challenge in practice.
• The character of the developed high sampling rate NILM frameworks 
should be event-driven to reduce computational complexity and 
make the NILM systems applicable in a real-world scenario.
• The disaggregation capabilities should include the combined and 
multi-state operation of appliances, which correspond to reality. In 
addition, noise, computation time, and other practical challenges 
should also be considered.
In this way, the maturity of the NILM system could be significantly 
increased so that its application in the real world would be reliable and 
feasible.
