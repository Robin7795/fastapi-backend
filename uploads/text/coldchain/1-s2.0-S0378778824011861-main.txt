With the increasing use of smart building technologies in modern infrastructures, a growing focus is on devel­
oping intelligent energy systems. This study focuses on a crucial part of this transition by investigating the 
application of a rule-based control method to harness the heat from wastewater to warm the ventilation lines in 
residential buildings. This research intends to enhance the integration of smart buildings into modern energy 
systems by prioritizing optimal performance and using creative control methods, mainly robust rule-based 
control schemes, thereby addressing current gaps and contributing to overall improvement. The proposed sys­
tem’s effectiveness is assessed and compared with a conventional model without the developed smart strategy 
from all facets. The system’s performance was assessed using hourly, monthly, seasonal, and annual metrics, with 
a detailed sensitivity analysis conducted to evaluate the proposed control strategy’s practicality. The findings 
reveal that the intelligent ventilation system achieves approximately 10% higher efficiency and conserves over 
1.4 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. Economically, the model demonstrates its feasibility through a marked 
reduction in heating costs, decreasing from 54.9 USD/MWh to 30.7 USD/MWh despite an initial investment of 
29,032 USD. The results also show that the smart integration system maintains elevated supply air temperatures 
during colder months, enhancing thermal efficiency and reducing reliance on external heat sources. Economic 
analysis further identifies the energy wheel as the largest cost component, representing 50% of the total in­
vestment. Monthly variations in heat recovery from wastewater and production via the energy wheel suggest that 
integrating these elements through a dynamic control system leads to significant operational savings and reduces 
the need for local district heating. During peak demand periods, radiators serve as the primary heating source. 
Air-handling units provide necessary ventilation and supplemental heating, allowing for efficient energy dis­
tribution and management across all seasons.
1. Introduction
1.1. The literature survey
For the past few decades, global energy usage has consistently 
increased for various primary energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear 
energy, and renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. Fossil 
fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, are the most commonly uti­
lized energy sources worldwide, accounting for approximately 80 % of 
global energy usage [1]. Nonetheless, their utilization has led to 
significant environmental issues, such as air pollution and greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions, resulting in climate change [2]. As the world’s 
population grows and developing countries increase their industriali­
zation and urbanization, the need for energy is anticipated to continue to 
rise. Consequently, governments and energy companies are progres­
sively investing in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power 
to lessen carbon emissions, increase cost-effectiveness [3], and mitigate 
the adverse effects of climate change [4]. However, switching to 
renewable energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels is gradual. In 
the interim, energy conservation and improved energy efficiency are 
essential in reducing our environmental impact [5].

The CO2 emissions rate per energy unit produced is a crucial measure 
to assess the ecological impact of diverse energy sources like renewable 
energy, nuclear power, and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas 
[6]. Fossil fuels have a higher CO2 emission rate per produced energy 
than renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, 
because their combustion discharges substantial amounts of carbon di­
oxide into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change and other 
environmental problems [7]. In order to mitigate the impact of climate 
change and achieve a sustainable energy future, it is essential to reduce 
the CO2 emission rate per unit of energy produced, which can be 
accomplished by transitioning to cleaner and sustainable energy sour­
ces, as well as enhancing energy efficiency in various sectors such as 
transportation, industry, and buildings [8]. Governments, businesses, 
and individuals can also play their part in reducing their carbon foot­
print by adopting demand-side energy management, promoting 
renewable energy use, and reducing energy usage through behavioral 
changes [9]. Reducing the CO2 emission rate per unit of energy pro­
duced will help preserve the environment, ensure energy security, and 
create a sustainable future for all.
China is investing heavily in renewable energy sources such as wind 
and solar power to decrease its reliance on coal and lower its CO2 
emissions per unit of energy produced [10]. The International Energy 
Agency reports that in 2020, China set a record by adding 136 GW of 
renewable energy capacity, accounting for 72 % of the global growth in 
renewable energy [11]. However, the issue of CO2 emissions per unit of 
energy produced in China is multifaceted and evolving. It is influenced 
by various factors such as economic growth, energy demand, and gov­
ernment policies. The CO2 emission rate varies depending on the type of 
energy source utilized. In 2021, China’s energy-related CO2 emissions 
were the highest worldwide, totaling 11.9 gigatons [12]. The average 
CO2 emission rate for electricity generation in China was around 772 g 
of CO2 per kWh in 2019 [13]. Coal, which is the primary energy source 
in China, has a higher CO2 emission rate per unit of energy produced 
than other energy sources and emitted approximately 10.05 billion 
metric tons of CO2 in 2019, according to the Global Energy Monitor 
[14]. Coal-fired power plants in China emit an average of roughly 1050 g 
of CO2 per kWh. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as solar and 
wind power have almost zero CO2 emissions during their operation. As a 
result, China is significantly investing in renewable energy sources to 
reduce its dependence on coal and lower its CO2 emissions per unit of 
energy produced [15,16].
Given the pressing global challenge of rising energy consumption 
and the corresponding increase in carbon emissions, particularly evident 
in rapidly industrializing nations like China, there is an urgent need for 
sustainable solutions [17]. China, being one of the largest contributors 
to global emissions, faces the dual challenge of continuing its develop­
ment while mitigating environmental impacts. This necessitates inno­
vative approaches that not only reduce energy consumption but also 
harness cleaner energy sources. One such promising approach is the 
development of near-zero energy buildings in stable distribution sys­
tems, which aim to significantly lower energy demand and incorporate 
advanced energy recovery techniques [18]. These buildings leverage 
renewable energy sources, thus presenting a viable pathway to 
achieving substantial reductions in carbon emissions while supporting 
China’s urbanization and growth [19,20].
The objective of achieving net-zero energy buildings is in line with a 
considerable decrease in energy usage and necessitates the utilization of 
renewable energy sources [21]. Enhancing building heat recovery is a 
highly effective strategy to attain this target [22,23]. The process in­
volves capturing waste heat from diverse sources within the building, 
including exhaust air, hot water, or industrial operations, and reusing it 
for space heating or hot water [24]. This method leads to a sustainable 
and energy-efficient building, significantly reducing the energy required 
for heating and cooling. Additionally, enhancing building heat recovery 
results in economic benefits, such as lower energy bills and decreased 
maintenance costs. It also improves indoor air quality (IAQ) and occu­
pant comfort by providing consistent and pleasant temperatures 
throughout the building [25]. Implementing heat recovery systems in 
buildings contributes to global climate goals by decreasing greenhouse 
gas emissions associated with energy consumption. Overall, enhancing 
heat recovery in buildings is a practical and cost-effective approach 
towards reaching net-zero energy buildings [26], providing benefits to 
the environment, the economy, and building inhabitants [27].
While energy recovery in buildings may not be identical to utilizing 
renewable resources, it can be equally effective in reducing wasted en­
ergy and improving energy efficiency. Energy recovery entails capturing 
and reusing energy that would typically be lost during heating, venti­
lation, and air conditioning (HVAC) operations, accomplished through 
heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) or energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) 
[28]. Conversely, renewable resources are naturally replenished energy 
sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Unlike energy re­
covery in buildings, renewable resources increase the overall energy 
supply and can offer long-term sustainable solutions for energy needs 
[29]. Despite differences in the energy sources they provide, both energy 
recovery in buildings and renewable resources are critical for reducing 
energy waste and boosting energy efficiency. Combining these

approaches can help establish a more sustainable and responsible energy 
future for generations to come.
Wastewater heat recovery is becoming increasingly crucial in 
buildings to lower energy usage and expenses [30,31]. This process in­
volves retrieving and reusing heat generated from activities like show­
ering, bathing, and washing, which can be redirected for space and 
water heating to decrease the need for additional energy sources 
[32,33]. By recuperating heat that would otherwise be lost, buildings 
can realize considerable energy savings, diminish their carbon footprint, 
and enhance their sustainability. Furthermore, since wastewater is a 
reliable thermal energy source, wastewater heat recovery systems can 
offer a steady and dependable heat source, making them especially 
valuable in colder climates with high energy requirements. Additionally, 
wastewater heat recovery systems generate substantial cost savings over 
time, notwithstanding their high initial installation costs [34]. These 
systems can also lengthen the lifespan of a building’s heating equipment 
by reducing the system’s workload and offering cost savings and other 
benefits to building occupants and owners.
Supply air temperature is a critical factor affecting both buildings’ 
heating demand and indoor air quality. The HVAC system delivers the 
supply air temperature to the occupied areas of the building. If the 
supply air temperature is too low, the indoor space will feel cold, and 
occupants will need more heating, resulting in higher heating demand. 
In addition, freezing is a common problem in cold climate regions due to 
cold outdoor air entering the ventilation heat recovery exchangers [25]. 
In contrast, if the supply air temperature is too high, the building may 
become too warm, causing excessive cooling demand and increased 
energy usage. Moreover, the supply air temperature significantly im­
pacts the indoor air quality of buildings. A low supply air temperature 
can lead to condensation and moisture accumulation in the building’s 
envelope and indoor surfaces, promoting mold growth and other indoor 
pollutants [35]. Conversely, high supply air temperatures can cause dry 
indoor air, leading to respiratory problems and discomfort for building 
occupants. Therefore, maintaining an optimal supply air temperature 
range is crucial to ensure occupant comfort and good indoor air quality 
while reducing heating demand and energy usage [36].
The cost-effectiveness of building energy systems shows a noticeable 
improvement as wastewater potential increases to a certain threshold. 
Several corroborative studies support this finding. For instance, Ber­
trand et al. [37] proposed methodologies to quantify building-specific 
energy costs and the potential for energy savings based on in-building 
wastewater heat recovery systems. Their research indicated that such 
systems can achieve integrated energy savings of 28 %-41 % in high- 
efficiency buildings. Golzar and Silviera [38] investigated the influ­
ence of wastewater heat recovery on centralized energy recovery per­
formance. They demonstrated that heat loss in the sewage system can 
lead to 5 % −
9 % lower heat recovery in centralized district heating 
systems compared to in-building heat recovery. Additionally, Xu et al. 
[39] reviewed various heat recovery technologies for building applica­
tions. They suggested that combining heat recovery with energy- 
efficient systems is a promising approach to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, thereby enabling residential buildings to meet high perfor­
mance and comfort standards. By incorporating these corroborative 
studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the prin­
ciples underpinning our observations. These references validate the 
relationship between ventilation heat recovery efficiency, levelized 
heating costs, and the significant role of wastewater temperature in 
enhancing system cost-effectiveness. The inclusion of this data un­
derscores the potential of wastewater heat recovery systems to 
contribute meaningfully to sustainable building practices, ultimately 
supporting global climate goals.
1.2. The scientific contribution
Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to explore a new 
approach to minimize the total energy loss in multi-residential buildings 
by recovering waste heat from exhaust air and wastewater. Specifically, 
we aim to harness the extra heat from wastewater and utilize it to 
augment the supply air temperature to the building, thereby reducing 
the overall heating demand of the building. Our approach takes into 
account the economic and environmental effects of applying this solu­
tion, and we will conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the 
long-term feasibility of this approach. By assessing the installed com­
ponents and considering their impact on reducing the building’s energy 
demand, an optimized, sustainable solution that supports both envi­
ronmental and economic benefits can be achieved [40].
The innovation of our research lies in the simultaneous integration of 
wastewater heat recovery and exhaust air heat recovery within a single 
system. Prior studies have either focused on individual waste energy 
recovery systems or implemented both systems in buildings but operated 
them independently. Our approach, however, synergistically combines 
these two systems to enhance overall efficiency. This integration in­
creases the supply air temperature, thereby reducing ventilation heat 
losses. Moreover, our system eliminates the need for energy-intensive 
devices like exhaust air heat pumps (EAHP) or wastewater heat pumps 
(WWHP), significantly improving economic feasibility for existing and 
new building installations. Additionally, we employ a rule-based control 
(RBC) strategy, which optimizes the operation of the integrated system 
by ensuring maximum efficiency and adaptability to varying building 
demands [41]. This innovative approach not only optimizes energy re­
covery but also offers a practical, cost-effective solution for micro-grid 
decentralized energy systems in sustainable building design [42].
2. The smart building energy system
This study aims to enhance the effectiveness of the ventilation system 
of a multi-residential building located in the climatic zone of Beijing. To 
achieve this, the researchers conducted transient simulations using the 
TRNSYS [43] software to evaluate the performance of the heat recovery 
systems installed in the building. The evaluation focused on several key 
factors, including the heating demand, ventilation temperatures, and the 
economic and environmental impacts of the proposed heat recovery 
systems. The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into the 
optimal design and operation of ventilation systems in similar buildings 
in the region, thereby promoting energy efficiency and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.
2.1. The studied system
In Fig. 1, a schematic representation of the investigated system is 
observed. The suggested heat recovery add-ins aimed at optimizing 
energy usage and reducing heat waste from major sources such as 
buildings, ventilated air, and wastewater are illustrated in this config­
uration. This innovative setup fully tackles the challenge of waste heat. 
Firstly, a district heating (DH) substation provides a space heating 
source. Secondly, the released wastewater enters a heat recovery loop 
after being roughly purified. Urban residential areas typically generate 
120–180 L of discarded wastewater per person [44], with temperature 
and flow rates varying based on daily timing and occupant density 
[45,46]. The warm wastewater feeds into the air preheater, which helps 
raise the incoming air temperature. Wastewater can be cooled to various 
temperatures depending on the outdoor air temperature and its flow rate 
to AHU. The cooled wastewater returns to the bottom of the storage tank 
(to maintain the temperature stratification) or is discarded to the 
sewerage. This depends on the wastewater outflow from the building. 
When the outdoor temperatures are near the desired temperature for the 
air supply, the air preheater cycle ceases to function. The heat recovery 
ventilation system provides treated fresh air to the building and effec­
tively recovers the energy used in the process. The temperature of the 
supply air has a direct impact on both the heating requirement of the 
building and the level of indoor thermal comfort perceived by the in­
habitants. When the external temperatures are low, the heat that is

obtained from the wastewater is utilized to raise the temperature of the 
incoming air. This, in turn, increases the temperature of the air supplied 
to the building, leading to enhanced indoor thermal comfort and 
decreased need for heating the building. The proposed system provides a 
sustainable and effective solution to reduce waste heat and optimize 
energy usage in buildings.
The rule-based control approach is the fundamental element of the 
intelligent ventilation system, which is responsible for its exceptional 
energy efficiency and thermal management performance. This approach 
entails a predetermined set of regulations that dictate the functioning of 
the crucial elements of the system, such as the energy wheel and the 
wastewater heat exchanger. The rule-based controller optimizes the use 
of thermal energy by altering parameters such as flow rates, temperature 
setpoints, and operational modes depending on real-time environmental 
data and building conditions. This clever adaptation optimizes heat 
extraction from wastewater and exhaust air while decreasing the need 
for external heating sources. The controller focuses on maintaining 
elevated supply air temperatures throughout colder months, hence 
improving thermal comfort and decreasing heating demand. The rule- 
based control technique effectively balances energy input and output

by continually monitoring and responding to variations in external 
temperature, indoor heating demand, and wastewater temperature. This 
ensures consistent performance and leads to significant cost savings 
throughout the year. This method increases energy efficiency and 
significantly decreases CO2 emissions, showcasing the environmental 
and economic feasibility of the intelligent ventilation system.
2.2. The building case
The building under study is a six-story residential apartment located 
in Beijing. The building has a total living area of 2050 m2, including 23 
apartments, first used in 2007. It is equipped with a mechanical venti­
lation system with heat recovery (MVHR). The study focuses on the 
building’s heating requirements, and Fig. 2 provides a detailed break­
down of the monthly heating demand for the building without any heat 
recovery systems. The graph also shows the outdoor temperature in 
Beijing throughout the year. The city experiences a wide range of tem­
peratures, with the lowest recorded daily temperature of −11.2 ◦C and 
the lowest hourly temperature of −15 ◦C. In contrast, the highest 
recorded daily temperature is 30.3 ◦C, with the highest hourly temper­
ature being 37.4 ◦C. This temperature variation highlights the chal­
lenges of maintaining a comfortable living environment within the 
building and the need for an effective heating and cooling system.
Ensuring an optimal indoor environment and sufficient supply of 
fresh air to indoors accentuates the significance of the ventilation system 
in establishing a heat equilibrium within the building. Enhancing the 
efficiency of the ventilation performance can substantially reduce 
notable heat losses experienced during the coldest months, as depicted 
in Fig. 2. The subsequent sections illustrate how harnessing wastewater 
heat can profoundly impact ventilation losses in the most effective 
manner.
3. Method
3.1. Transient system simulation software
To evaluate the system’s performance before and after optimization 
changes and highlight the impact of air preheating in cold winter con­
ditions, we run yearly dynamic simulations using TRNSYS software. 
These simulations evaluate the energy demand of the building under 
study and compare supply temperatures after modifications, showcasing 
the advantages of heat recovery methods. Table 1 presents an overview 
of key simulation components in TRNSYS used for simulating and 
optimizing system performance:
In the present work, TRNSYS software is predominantly utilized as 
an equation-solving tool based on common numerical methodologies for 
validating the components. TRNSYS models each physical piece of 
thermodynamic equipment using a component that has been created 
using Fortran source code. A multitude of persons have authored 
TRNSYS components, verified their accuracy using experimental data, 
and granted the University of Wisconsin Madison Solar Lab authoriza­
tion to distribute these components to other TRNSYS users. The source 
code and description of these components have been uploaded online. 
Furthermore, the TRNSYS handbook includes a comprehensive compi­
lation of references for each standard component. Thus, as a result, there 
is no longer a requirement to validate TRNSYS component models. In the 
literature, several articles have simulated HVAC systems using TRNSYS 
but have not validated the components [50–59].
3.2. Performance indicators
The performance of the studied system is assessed by examining total 
energy savings and associated costs. Although the additional compo­
nents required to capture and utilize recovered wastewater energy 
contribute to upfront investment costs, these costs may be offset by the 
energy savings achieved and the associated reduction in environmental 
impact. To thoroughly evaluate this balance, a parametric study is 
conducted, analyzing various design parameters of system components 
to determine their impact on overall energy savings and CO2 emission 
reduction. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of 
the trade-offs between initial investment and long-term sustainability 
benefits, ultimately guiding the development of cost-effective and 
environmentally favorable design solutions. These parameters are the 
heat recovery efficiencies at the AHU and the wastewater heat 
exchanger, the storage tank volume, the total living area occupied by a 
person in the building, and the lowest temperature at which wastewater 
can be cooled. These parameters identify the system performance, 
showing the total energy savings per cost and the total CO2 emission.
The techno-economic-environmental investigation deals with 
finding the entire system’s performance efficiency, levelized cost of 
heating (LCOH), total investment cost, and CO2 saving. Therefore, the 
performance efficiency of the system is defined by equation (1): 
η = Tsupply,zone −TOutdoor
Treturn,zone −TOutdoor
× 100
(1) 
where, Tsupply,zone, Treturn,zone, and TOutdoor are the supply and return air 
temperatures to/from the building and the outdoor temperature, 
respectively. The economic evaluation uses the particular cost theory to 
determine the total cost rate, as denoted by Equation (2) [60,61].

The LCOH is determined by dividing the total cost rate by heating 
production, serving as a metric to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 
proposed smart system in dollars per megawatt. The total cost rate 
( ˙ZTotal) is expressed as the combination of the investment costs and the 
operating and maintenance costs. Additionally, CRF, τ, and γ represent

4. Results and Discussions
After simulating the proposed smart model in TRNSYS, a compre­
hensive technical, environmental, and economic evaluation is con­
ducted and compared with the conventional system without the 
wastewater heat recovery strategy. For this, the key metrics, including 
the performance efficiency, investment costs, heating costs, and heating 
generated by the air handling unit and supplied by the radiators, are 
assessed through the year, season, month, and hour. Additionally, 
sensitivity assessment is carried out to analyze how the efficiency, in­
vestment costs, and heating costs are affected when the significant 
variables, including the energy wheel’s epsilon, wastewater temperature 
leaving the tank, number of residences, and heat exchanger’s epsilon, 
are changed.
Table 2 compares the efficiency, investment, and heating costs of the 
proposed smart model equipped with the wastewater heat recovery 
strategy with the conventional system. According to the table, the 
effectiveness of the conventional ventilation system is 85 %. This in­
dicates that while 15 % of the energy input is wasted as waste heat, the 
remaining 85 % is successfully used for heating. However, when com­
bined with a wastewater heat recovery technique, the suggested intel­
ligent ventilation system increases efficiency to 95.4 %. The huge rise in 
numbers demonstrates the successful implementation of the heat 
recovery system, which effectively absorbs and utilizes thermal energy 
from wastewater. This results in reduced energy wastage and a notable 
enhancement in the system’s overall energy efficiency. The table further 
indicates that the smart model necessitates a more significant initial cost 
of 29,032 USD when implementing the wastewater heat recovery 
approach. The increase is due to the additional components and tech­
nology required to capture and reuse heat from wastewater. Although 
the initial cost is higher, the investment in the heat recovery system can 
be rationalized due to its long-term savings and increased efficiency. 
This is justified due to the substantial decrease in heating costs (from 
54.9 USD to 30.7 USD per MWh), as indicated in Table 2. To establish a 
more easily understandable measure of the investment cost, we have 
standardized the total investment by considering a total area of 2050 m2, 
which includes 23 flats with four occupants in each apartment. As 
indicated in the table, the normalized investment costs for the conven­
tional system are 5.9 USD/m2 and 132 USD/person whle the corre­
sponding values for the porposed novel system with wasteheat recovery 
are 14.2 USD/m2 and 315.5 USD/person. Finally, it can be observed that 
the proposed smart integration results in 1.47 tonnes/year of CO2 saving 
compared to a similar system without wastewater heat recovery.
Fig. 3 compares the hourly variation of supply air temperature 
entering the room from the ventilation system and the time duration 
curve of space heating demand with and without wastewater heat re­
covery strategy to look into the effectiveness of the proposed smart 
integration in detail. According to Fig. 3(a), during the cold hours when 
the building requires heat, the air supply temperature of the proposed 
model equipped with wastewater heat recovery has higher values, 
leading to improved thermal efficiency and reduced primary energy 
used. Fig. 3(b) demonstrates a consistent reduction of space heating 
demand across various time points, indicating the reduction of reliance 
on any external heat source. Significant energy savings are shown by the 
reduced need for space heating while employing the wastewater heat 
recovery system. The technology lowers energy use and operating costs 
by reducing the need for extra heating through heat recovery from 
wastewater. The benefits of incorporating a wastewater heat recovery 
method into the smart ventilation system are clearly demonstrated by 
evaluating the supply air temperature and space heating demand trends. 
Thanks to better energy efficiency, more thermal comfort, and sub­
stantial long-term savings, the higher supply air temperatures and lower 
heating demands make the extra expenditure worthwhile. This decrease 
in primary energy use highlights the system’s capacity to maximize 
energy efficiency while preserving pleasant indoor temperatures.
Thermal energy storage (TES) systems incorporating stratification 
have notable advantages in maximizing energy efficiency and improving 
system performance. Stratification is the process of water naturally 
separating into separate layers based on temperature within the storage 
tank, with hotter water at the top and cooler water at the bottom. 
Temperature layering enables the system to extract the necessary water 
temperature from the relevant layer, reducing the need for extra heating 
or cooling and optimizing the utilization of stored thermal energy. 
Stratified TES systems can enhance energy utilization, save operational 
expenses, and prolong the lifespan of HVAC equipment. In order to 
reflect the effect of stratification over the tank, Fig. 5 illustrates the 
hourly variation of the temperature at the 1st and 10th nodes and the 
average tank temperature. Fig. 4 shows the schematic of the storage 
tank, inflows and outflows, and the stratification nodes used in the 
simulation.
The temperature at Node 1 remains consistently elevated and stable 
for most of the period, with an initial average of approximately 20 ◦C 
and subsequent minor fluctuations. This suggests that the uppermost 
layer of the tank, where hot water is held, can maintain higher tem­
peratures with great efficiency. Node 10′s temperature shows large 
variations, from 14.7 ◦C to 18.9 ◦C. The temperature changes observed 
in the tank’s bottom layer, which contains cooler water, appear more 
dynamic due to the heat being added and removed from the tank. The 
average temperature exhibits a pattern that falls within the temperature

range of Node 1 and Node 10. The temperature initially begins at 
approximately 20 ◦C, lowers during intensified heat extraction, and 
gradually rises when heat is reintroduced into the tank.
Fig. 6 shows the investment cost of each component and its pro­
portion in the overall costs. The energy wheel is the system’s most costly 
component, accounting for around 50 % of the total investment cost. Its 
effectiveness in lowering total energy use and enhancing the system’s 
thermal performance justifies its high cost. The tank is the second most 
expensive component, with an initial cost of 4,000 USD. Because robust 
substances that can resist thermal expansion and contraction and 
effectively insulate against heat loss are required, the cost is somewhat 
expensive. Also, it can be observed that the heat exchanger, with almost 
a 12 % share of the total investment cost, is a key component from the 
economic point of view. The figure further illustrates that the cheaper 
elements, like the fan, valves, and pump, are easily accessible in typical 
designs and perform necessary but simpler tasks.
Fig. 7 compares the monthly share of heat generated from the 
wastewater and recovered via the energy wheel to analyze the impact of 
each source on improving the air supply temperature. The energy wheel 
exhibits substantial heat recovery from January to March and October to 
December. Between May and September, both the energy wheel and 
wastewater heat recovery systems exhibit minimal or no heat produc­
tion, indicating reduced heating requirements during the warmer 
months. The energy wheel frequently outperforms the wastewater sys­
tem in terms of heat recovery, demonstrating its high efficiency and 
efficacy in absorbing and reusing heat inside the ventilation system. The 
figure further reveals that although the wastewater system makes large 
contributions during peak months, its performance is less effective 
during transitional and warm months, indicating a higher sensitivity to 
seasonal fluctuations. This suggests that the effectiveness of wastewater 
heat recovery is contingent upon the presence of wastewater heat, which 
may vary in accordance with usage trends. The energy wheel and the 
wastewater heat recovery systems both show high heat recovery rates in

the winter and low production in the summer. This seasonal perfor­
mance means that the system is very effective when heating is at its 
highest and uses less energy when it’s warmer outside.
In order to analyze the share of each source and compare their 
production in total heating demand, the heat production by the air 
handling unit and the radiators is illustrated in Fig. 8. Radiators emit 
substantially greater heat than air-handling units all around the year. In 
January, radiators generate 16.4 MWh of energy, whereas the AHU 
generates 8.9 MWh. This pattern remains constant throughout the 
colder months, indicating that radiators are crucial in supplying primary 
heating during high demand. The AHU provides additional heating, 
guarantees sufficient ventilation, and preserves indoor air quality. The 
reduced contribution of this device, in comparison to radiators, indicates 
that its primary function is to assist in temperature regulation rather 
than serving as the major source of warmth. The decrease in heating 
contributions during the warmer months (May to September) results 
from effective energy management, which prevents wasteful heating 
when the ambient temperatures are elevated. The figure shows that 
combining air AHU and radiators achieves a balanced and effective 
heating system. During periods of high demand, radiators play a more 
prominent role, while the AHU assists by ensuring proper ventilation 
and providing extra heat as necessary.
Fig. 9 compares the monthly and seasonal variation of heat provided 
by the air handling unit via wastewater heat recovery and/or energy 
wheels. The AHU generates the highest amount of heat from December 
to February, reaching its maximum levels in January (8.9 MWh) and 
December (8.2 MWh). This increased demand is due to the lower tem­
peratures outside, necessitating substantial heating to keep the indoor 
environment comfortable. The heat output of the AHU decreases 
significantly throughout the summer months, reaching values that are 
either at or very close to 0 MWh. This suggests a low need for heating 
due to higher ambient temperatures. The seasonal changes show that the 
maximum productions of 22.2 MWh and 15.9 MWh correspond to 
Winter and Autumn because the high heating demands require more 
input energy to maintain the indoor environment within the comfort 
zone. The seasonal differences in heat production demonstrate how well 
the system adjusts to shifting weather patterns and makes sure energy 
isn’t squandered when it’s not needed.
Sensitivity analysis is an essential tool for assessing parameters in 
smart energy systems, providing multiple advantages. Sensitivity anal­
ysis is a method that involves systematically changing input parameters 
to determine which variables have the most influence on the 
performance and efficiency of energy systems. This method improves 
the comprehension of system behavior, resulting in more resilient and 
dependable models. It assists in prioritizing research and allocating re­
sources by emphasizing the crucial elements that impact energy opti­
mization and sustainability, therefore enhancing decision-making 
processes. Fig. 10 demonstrates the variation of main metrics, including 
efficiency, investment cost, and heating price, with key variables like the 
energy wheel’s epsilon, wastewater temperature leaving the tank, 
number of residences, and heat exchanger’s epsilon. According to 
Fig. 10(a), as the epsilon value of the energy wheel goes from 0.7 to 0.9, 
there is a corresponding improvement in the system’s efficiency. The 
upward trajectory suggests that increasing epsilon values improves en­
ergy wheel performance, raising the system’s overall efficiency. The 
reason for this is probably the enhanced heat transfer capabilities, which 
lead to a more efficient preheating of the air inlet.
With the increase in epsilon, the investment cost likewise exhibits a 
rising trend. The price progressively increases to 14,200 USD at an 
epsilon of 0.9 from 12,500 USD at an epsilon of 0.7. The greater capital 
cost necessary for more sophisticated energy wheels with improved 
performance attributes is reflected in this trend. Similar growing trends 
are seen in the levelized cost of heating, albeit comparatively small 
compared to investment and efficiency costs. An epsilon of 0.7 begins at 
30.7 USD per MWh and rises to 32.3 USD per MWh with an epsilon of 
0.9. This rise can be ascribed to the greater maintenance costs related to 
better-efficiency systems and potential investment costs. In summary, 
raising the energy wheel’s epsilon increases efficiency but also raises 
investment and heating costs. These patterns emphasize how crucial it is 
to balance cost-benefit analysis with performance enhancements while 
developing and refining these systems.
Fig. 10(b) demonstrates the system’s efficiency is relatively stable for 
most of the wastewater temperature range exiting the tank, averaging 
94.7 %. This implies that the system’s efficiency is reasonably steady 
within the given temperature range, suggesting that variables other than 
wastewater temperature may significantly impact efficiency. The in­
vestment cost remains at 13,700 USD for most of the temperature range. 
There is a gradual decline in temperature starting at 4.55 ◦C, reaching a 
value of 13,500 USD at 6.3 ◦C, followed by an increase to 14,000 USD at 
7 ◦C. This trend indicates that the system’s cost-effectiveness improves 
marginally as the wastewater temperature exiting the tank increases to a 
certain threshold. However, greater temperatures may need more so­
phisticated or supplementary components beyond this point, leading to 
increased investment costs. The figure further shows that the heating 
cost remains quite stable, with few fluctuations, at approximately 31.9 
USD per MWh for temperatures up to 4.9 ◦C. There is a small decline, 
dropping to 31.3 USD per MWh at 6.3 ◦C and then rising to 32.6 USD per 
MWh at 7 ◦C. This pattern is consistent with the relationship between 
heating prices and investment costs. As heating prices decrease, there is 
a minor decrease in investment costs up to a certain point. However, as 
temperatures rise beyond that point, the costs of investment increase. 
Based on the trends observed, it can be concluded that the system’s ef­
ficiency remains consistent with a moderate range of wastewater tem­
peratures that leave the tank. However, both investment costs and 
heating prices exhibit slight enhancements before rising again at higher 
temperatures.
Fig. 10(c) depicts that the system’s efficiency increases as the num­
ber of occupies rises. It increases gradually to 95.8 % efficiency with 80 
dwellings from 92.8 % efficiency with 40 residences. This pattern in­
dicates that as the system handles higher loads, its efficiency increases 
with the number of homes. This is probably because of economies of 
scale and better use of the heat recovery process. As the number of 
dwellings rises, the investment cost falls. For 40 residences, it starts at 
16,000 USD and decreases to 12,300 USD for 80 residences. This drop in 
the system’s per-residence cost can be explained by the fixed costs being 
spread over more units. Larger systems might also profit from bulk 
purchasing and more effective labor and material utilization. A growing 
number of residences leads to a drop in the heating costs. The price starts

at 37.9 USD per MWh for 40 houses and decreases to 28.3 USD per MWh 
for 80 residences. This decrease corresponds to the declining investment 
expense and demonstrates enhanced cost-effectiveness as the system 
caters to more households. Distributing operational costs across more 
units results in a reduced heating price per home.
Eventually, Fig. 10(d) shows that the system’s efficiency positively 
correlates with enhancing the heat exchanger’s efficiency. As the level of 
effectiveness rises, the system’s efficiency likewise enhances. This is 
because the heat from the wastewater is transferred more efficiently to 
the incoming air, resulting in a more effective preheating. This decreases 
the energy other sources need to reach the desired indoor temperature. 
In most cases, the investment cost decreases as the heat exchanger be­
comes more efficient. Increased heat exchange efficiency lessens the 
load on the system, reducing the need for costly auxiliary equipment. A 
lower levelized cost of heating is another benefit of a more efficient heat 
exchanger. This reflects the lower operational expenses linked to sys­
tems with better efficiency. The total cost per unit of heat delivered 
decreases due to improved heat recovery, which decreases the demand

for additional heating energy. Investing in more effective heat ex­
changers is economically beneficial, as the figure shows a direct corre­
lation between better heat exchanger efficiency and reduced heating 
expenses.
In order to gain an in-depth knowledge of the performance of the 
present study, a comparison between the results and those of prior 
studies that examined the utilization of wastewater heat recovery sys­
tems in buildings is investigated. Table 3 compares the main indicators: 
energy saving, CO2 emission reduction, and cost saving. According to 
the table, Golzar and Silveira [38], Bertrand et al., and Ni et al. [63]
reported energy savings of 5 %-9%, 28 %-41 %, and 20 % without 
performing a comprehensive economic and environmental assessment. 
In comparison, the present work performed a comprehensive techno- 
economic-environmental evaluation, reporting a 10 % energy saving, 
an annual CO2 emission reduction of 1.4 tonnes, and a cost saving of 24 
USD/MWh. This comparison emphasizes that the present system pro­
vides moderate energy savings compared to the systems developed by 
Bertrand et al. [37] and Ni et al. [63]. However, the studied system 
stands out by effectively combining significant reductions in CO2 
emissions and substantial cost savings. This highlights its superior 
overall performance in improving energy efficiency and sustainability in 
building energy management.
5. Conclusions
This article introduces a novel HVAC system to revolutionize smart 
residential buildings. The system consists of a dynamic control frame­
work for energy use reduction and effectively supplies the energy pro­
duction/usage/waste through smart component integration. The core of 
this concept is reusing the wastewater’s huge heat potential for pre­
heating the inlet air entering the air handling unit. The system’s feasi­
bility is assessed and compared with the conventional HVAC model 
comprising an energy wheel from all points of view. The hourly, 
monthly, seasonal, and annual indicators are assessed, and a sensitivity 
analysis is done to examine the system’s viability thoroughly. In the 
following the concluding remarks and highlights are listed in detail: 
• Energy efficiency improvement: The proposed system demon­
strated a notable improvement in energy efficiency, increasing from 
85 % in conventional systems to 95.4 %. This signifies a substantial 
decrease in primary energy use and a highly efficient thermal energy 
usage from wastewater.
• Cost saving: The suggested model’s economic viability is revealed 
by the large reduction in the system’s heating costs, which decreased 
from 54.9 USD/MWh to 30.7 USD/MWh. This reduction occurred 
despite the greater initial costs of 29,032 USD.
• CO2 emission reduction: The proposed smart ventilation system 
achieved an annual reduction of 1.47 tonnes of CO2 emissions, 
demonstrating its capacity to promote sustainability and diminish 
the carbon footprint of residential buildings.
• Less reliance on district heating: Throughout the winter, the sys­
tem sustained elevated supply air temperatures, enhancing thermal 
efficiency and significantly reducing dependence on external heat 
sources. This consistent performance led to a substantial and 
continuous reduction in the building’s overall space heating demand, 
contributing to energy savings and a more stable indoor climate. By 
minimizing reliance on additional heating, the system improved 
operational efficiency and promoted cost savings and environmental 
benefits through reduced energy consumption.
• Economic viability: The energy wheel, which accounted for 
approximately 50 % of the total investment cost, was vital in 
reducing energy use and enhancing thermal efficiency, hence justi­
fying its higher price. The additional components, such as the ther­
mal energy storage tank and heat exchanger, substantially affected 
the system’s economic and operational efficiency.
• Seasonal performance: Seasonally, the energy wheel and waste­
water heat recovery systems performed differently, producing less 
heat recovery in the summer and more in the winter. Regarding heat 
reuse efficiency, the energy wheel performed better than the 
wastewater system in most cases.
• System integration: Air handling units were integrated with radi­
ators in a hybrid configuration to create a balanced and efficient 
heating solution. This approach ensures reliable primary heating and 
adequate ventilation, while radiators provide supplementary heating 
during periods of high demand. The hybrid system adapts to varying 
load requirements, enhancing thermal comfort and energy efficiency 
by dynamically distributing heat as needed across the building.
• Sensitivity analysis: The sensitivity study identified several key 
variables that substantially impact system efficiency. These include 
the number of households served, the temperature of wastewater 
exiting the tank, the performance of the heat exchanger, and the 
epsilon (ε) value of the energy wheel. Optimal system design and 
operation hinge on balancing these factors to maximize energy re­
covery and overall system performance. Fine-tuning these variables 
ensures the system can achieve both efficiency and reliability, 
adapting effectively to varying operational demands.
